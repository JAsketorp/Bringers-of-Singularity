Key Issues Arising for from the Civil Partnerships Act September 2005 Has the English House of Bishops ' response to the Government 's recently enacted Civil Partnership legislation put the Church of England in a position where it should be disciplined as the North American Churches have because of their open ordination of active homosexuals and the approval of same-sex partnership rites ?MARK
As the rift between the Anglican global south and Anglo-American Anglicanism becomes deeper ,COMMA this is a question about which clarity is essential .PERIOD
If the answer is ' yes ' and a diocesan bishop is not willing to distance himself from the policy ,COMMA then parish clergy have a duty to distance themselves from such a bishop by declaring themselves to be in ' impaired communion ' .PERIOD
While affirming historic biblical teaching on marriage ,COMMA their failure not only to oppose the legislation ,COMMA but also to allow clergy to enter into Civil Partnerships ,COMMA means that the House of Bishops has endorsed legislation which creates same sex marriage in all but name .PERIOD
It is clear that the legislation is intended to create a new social institution which enables and legitimises same sex sexual relationships for the following reasons : a ) The provisions of the Civil Partnership Act mimic marriage .PERIOD
For example there are prohibited degrees of relationship and one cannot marry if already in a Civil Partnership.PERIOD b ) The political context has been that of legitimising active homosexual relationships .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA Jacqui Smith MP ,COMMA Deputy Minister for Women and Equality ,COMMA claimed that �The Civil Partnership Bill underlines the inherent value of committed same-sex relationships.PERIOD�(Government Fact Sheet July 2004).PERIOD c ) Now that the legislation has become law ,COMMA the agenda to create a new social institution has been revealed in quite unambiguous terms .PERIOD
Meg Munn ,COMMA Deputy Equality Minister is reported as saying that �once an anomaly in pensions legislation had been ironed out in five years ,COMMA there would be no legal difference between civil partnerships and marriage� and �like other couples ,COMMA civil partners will be able to " marry " in approved venues .PERIOD
The only discrepancy between a partnership and a marriage will be the way the union is formalized.PERIOD� ( Daily Telegraph 15th September 2005 ; full article below ).PERIOD The House of Bishops ' claim that ' The Government has stated that it has no intention of introducing ' same -sex marriage ' .PERIOD
Civil partnerships are not a form of marriage.PERIOD ' ( July Statement paragraph 8 ) is clearly wrong .PERIOD
The kindest interpretation is that the Bishops have been extremely naive .PERIOD
The House of Bishops ' statement allows clergy to enter into Civil Partnerships on the basis of assurances that they are not in a sexually active relationship .PERIOD
This is the basis on which they seek to accept the legislation while maintaining doctrinal consistency ,COMMA but the attempt is deeply implausible because it ignores the church context : i ) Active homosexual relationships have been tolerated in many dioceses for decades so this would be a reversal of existing ' on the ground ' policy.PERIOD ii ) The discipline is completely unworkable in practice touching as it does on private and intimate behaviour ,COMMA not to mention the awkwardness of defining what is meant by a ' sexual relationship'.PERIOD iii ) The Bishop of Worcester has already broken ranks ,COMMA rejecting the policy of asking for assurances of celibacy and encouraging other bishops to do likewise .PERIOD
If no discipline is exercised against Peter Selby and others of like mind it will be entirely clear that the Church of England has no will to maintain the biblical and historic nature of marriage even within its own ranks .PERIOD
It will be de facto in the same position as the North American Churches .PERIOD
The House of Bishop 's statement includes the comment that the House ' considers that lay people who registered Civil Partnerships ought not to be asked for assurances about the nature of their relationship before being admitted to baptism ,COMMA confirmation and communion ' .PERIOD
This is a significant broadening of the boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour for a committed Christian because : a ) Being in a Civil Partnership is no longer deemed relevant to the requirement that those who come to baptism should reject the devil and all rebellion against God ,COMMA renounce the deceit and corruption of evil ,COMMA and repent of the sins that separate us from God and neighbour ,COMMA whereas if the historic teaching of the Bible is truly believed ,COMMA and given that Civil Partnerships create an institution specifically tailored for those in same-sex relationships ,COMMA assurances are more not less necessary .PERIOD
The biblical principle is that we should ' Test everything .PERIOD
Hold on to the good .PERIOD
Avoid every kind of evil ' ( 1 Thess .PERIOD
5:21,COMMA22 ) ,COMMA not sail as close to the wind as possible.PERIOD b ) Same sex partnerships are seen as belonging to that realm of ethical issues where conscience should be respected ,COMMA but it is difficult to imagine racism ,COMMA for example ,COMMA being so treated .PERIOD
It is clear that the Bishops collectively have already given up on the idea that biblical teaching on marriage and gender is a fundamental to biblical ethics and authority .PERIOD
It has been reduced instead to the nature of a guideline and matter for ongoing debate .PERIOD
The shifts seen in the House of Bishops ' response to the Civil Partnership legislation are instructive in the way they build on and amplify previous departures from biblical standards .PERIOD
In a climate where confusion has already been created ,COMMA a clear moral and biblical vision is increasingly difficult to maintain.PERIOD a ) The principle that candidates for baptism in Civil Partnerships should be accepted with no questions asked about their relationship ,COMMA despite a context which lead one reasonably to expect that there is a sexual relationship is clearly consistent with the guidance of the earlier House of Bishop 's Report ' Issues in Human Sexuality ' of 1991 which indicated tolerance for lay same sex relationships ,COMMA but not amongst the clergy.PERIOD b ) The ' no questions asked ' approach is also justified in regard to those bringing children to baptism on the basis of the 2003 Adoption Act ,COMMA which was itself eased in its passage through Parliament by the support of the Church of England 's Children 's Society for gay adoption .PERIOD
Conclusion While it is possible to argue that in terms of words on paper the Church of England has maintained biblical teaching on marriage ,COMMA the reality is the reverse .PERIOD
Such a fiction can only be maintained by ignoring the facts of the political and ecclesial context ,COMMA in summary that : a ) the Civil Partnership Act is a deliberate attempt to create an new social institution of same sex marriage b ) the Bishops of the Church of England continue to tolerate without any effective discipline behaviour which is clearly at odds with its claimed allegiance to historic biblical teaching .PERIOD
In an increasingly decadent society ,COMMA the Bishops blur the boundaries between right and wrong and confuse those who are called to fight against the world ,COMMA the flesh and the devil .PERIOD
If they cannot any longer shepherd the Church in a godly way ,COMMA we must look for other shepherds who can ,COMMA while in the meantime local clergy should conscientiously reject the ministry of those shepherds who are harming the flock .PERIOD
Charles Raven Footnotes ' The Act closely and exhaustively replicates for Civil Partnerships virtually every provision in law which relates to marriage ' Bishop Michael Scott-Joynt New Directions August 2005 ' A campaign to promote gay " marriages " was launched by the Government yesterday with the assistance of two same-sex couples who are planning to " tie the knot� .PERIOD
Ministers believe that some in the lesbian and gay community are still unaware of the Civil Partnerships Act ,COMMA which comes into force on Dec 5.PERIOD Launching the campaign at Westminster Register Office ,COMMA Meg Munn ,COMMA the deputy equality minister ,COMMA said that ,COMMA once an anomaly in pensions legislation had been ironed out in five years ,COMMA there would be no legal difference between civil partnerships and marriage .PERIOD
Partners will have the same rights as married couples in tax ,COMMA employment ,COMMA benefits and housing and ,COMMA if the relationship breaks down ,COMMA the courts can rule on the division of property and maintenance payments .PERIOD
Like other couples ,COMMA civil partners will be able to " marry " in approved venues .PERIOD
The only discrepancy between a partnership and a marriage will be the way the union is formalised .PERIOD
While couples marrying have to recite a set of words ,COMMA civil partners will be legally " joined " when they sign a register.PERIOD ' Daily Telegraph 15th September 2005 ' I dare to hope that bishops will find better ways of relating to such couples than seeking assurances ,COMMA and I believe many of us will .PERIOD
But ,COMMA sorry as I am to need to say so ,COMMA the words we have uttered on this topic will not help either bishops or those to whom they minister .PERIOD
For the desire of people to enter civil partnerships ,COMMA and the willingness of the Government to make that possible ,COMMA represent something far more hopeful than this document makes it appear ' .PERIOD
Bishop Peter Selby ,COMMA Church Times ,COMMA 19th August 2005 .PERIOD
For Christians ,COMMA marriage- that is the lifelong union between a man and a woman - remains the proper context for sexual activity .PERIOD
In its approach to civil partnerships the Church will continue to uphold that standard ,COMMA to affirm the value of committed ,COMMA sexually abstinent friendships between people of the same sex and to minister sensitively and pastorally to those Christians who conscientiously decide to order their lives differently .PERIOD
House of Bihops ' statement on Civil Pternships ,COMMA para 27 .PERIOD
The House of Bishops ' statement of December 1991 - Issues in Human Sexuality - which states that ' heterosexuality and homosexuality are not equally congruous with the observed order of Creation or with the insights of revelation as the Church engages with these in the light of her pastoral ministry ' ,COMMA that the conscientious decision of those who enter into homophile relationships must be respected and that the Church must not ' reject those who sincerely believe it is God 's call to them ' .PERIOD
Nevertheless ,COMMA because of ' the distinctive nature of their calling ,COMMA status and consecration ' the clergy ' cannot claim the liberty to enter into sexually active homophile relationships ' From The House of Bishops Statement on Civil Partnerships ,COMMA July 2005 para 6 The Adoption Act 2003 allows for couples that are not married ,COMMA opposite-sex and same-sex ,COMMA to adopt children .PERIOD
The Civil Partnership Act includes legislation about children and reflects an expectation that some people who register civil partnerships will have children in their care .PERIOD
While the House of Bishops recognises many in the Church have reservations about these developments ,COMMA we believe an unconditional welcome should be given to children in our churches ,COMMA regardless of the structure of the family in which they are being brought up.PERIOD ' From The House of Bishops Statement on Civil Partnerships ,COMMA July 2005 para 24
A nightmare scenario !EXCL
Lee is struggling with an assignment on his Leisure and Recreation Course .PERIOD
So far things have gone well because most of the work has been about fitness training and sport .PERIOD
However ,COMMA his latest task is on " Conflicts of interest on Lake Windermere " .PERIOD
Lee lives in the middle of a city and realises he knows very little about the countryside and even less about Lake Windermere .PERIOD
He turns to the Internet for help .PERIOD
He 's delighted to comes across a Web site that seems to offer lots of information about a proposed 10mph speed limit on Lake Windermere .PERIOD
He notes down lots of details from the site and puts it into his coursework .PERIOD
He is horrified when his teacher hands him back his assignment and he sees he has failed !EXCL
After chatting with his tutor ,COMMA he realises that the Web site he had used for his essay was produced by a local speedboat operator who is campaigning against the proposed speed limit on Lake Windermere .PERIOD
As a result ,COMMA the information available on the site only presented one side of the argument .PERIOD
Andy Sargentee ( Jeff Bridges ) is a perpetual under-achiever whose get-rich-quick schemes frequently land him in trouble .PERIOD
Desperate to prove his worth to his teenage son - who is now living with a well-off stepfather - Andy finds inspiration in dirty movies and resolves to make his own amateur porn film with the help of his none-too-bright friends .PERIOD
But what looks to be an easy prospect on paper quickly proves far more difficult in reality ,COMMA particularly as finding the right women to appear in the project proves easier said than done .PERIOD
What we say It 's very rare to find a bad Jeff Bridges film - but The Moguls has to represent one of the most misguided choices of his distinguished career .PERIOD
Designed as a life-affirming comedy about a small town coming together ,COMMA the film ends up being a sexist ,COMMA homophobic mess with a dose of racism thrown in .PERIOD
It also wastes the talents of a strong support cast ,COMMA which includes Tim Blake Nelson as a love-struck refrigerator repairman ,COMMA Ted Danson as a closet gay " womaniser " ,COMMA William Fichtner and Joe Pantoliano as the town idiots ( the latter is even called Some Idiot ) ,COMMA and Glenne Headley as a tart with a heart searching for love in all the wrong places .PERIOD
The Moguls actually boasts quite an intriguing premise ,COMMA but is so woefully crass that it 's likely to offend rather than inspire anyone who sees it .PERIOD
Evidence of its desperation to find laughs comes from the number of ways its characters strive to think of new terms for genitalia or sexual positions ,COMMA while attempts to make its characters seem endearing by highlighting their social awkwardness merely grate .PERIOD
What 's worse is the film 's consistent ability to turn off viewers with its racist ,COMMA sexist and homophobic stereotypes .PERIOD
Women ,COMMA especially ,COMMA get a rough deal ,COMMA appearing as sex objects throughout ( Glenne 's character only agrees to appear in the movie because she has already lost most of her dignity ) ,COMMA while a trio of black men are cast and then ridiculed because their manhood does n't measure up to scratch .PERIOD
Ted Danson ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has to contend with a script that requires him to throw sexist comments around like confetti while apologising for the fact he is gay .PERIOD
By the time the film reaches its obvious and banal conclusion ,COMMA audiences should have become utterly sick of its contrivances .PERIOD
The overall result is a proper movie stiff .PERIOD

What makes instant messaging work for business ?MARK
The concept of presence .PERIOD
Here 's how it can work in other applications .PERIOD
You may think you 're on the leading edge of technology if you 're a heavy email user ,COMMA but email in its current form is an archaic communications medium .PERIOD
It 's the big black rotary phone of your parents ' house compared to the tiny mobile phone you carry with you today .PERIOD
And what is email 's greatest weakness ?MARK
No ,COMMA not spam .PERIOD
Email lacks presence .PERIOD
If you use instant messaging ,COMMA you know the difference between old-fashioned email and the power of instant messaging .PERIOD
And it 's not the speed .PERIOD
It 's the fact that before you send an instant message ,COMMA you have a very good idea if the person on the other end is there to receive it .PERIOD
This makes instant messages ,COMMA or IMs ,COMMA succeed when email fails .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA if you want to see if Joe down the hall can join you for lunch ,COMMA sending email is a bad idea because you do n't know if Joe is at his desk to read the mail .PERIOD
Telephoning is intrusive .PERIOD
Walking down the hall would tear you away from the other tasks you 're juggling .PERIOD
But with IM ,COMMA first ,COMMA you find out if Joe is either at his desk or already gone ( so find another lunch date ) ; second ,COMMA you know that if he is there and you send him a note ,COMMA he 'll see it .PERIOD
There 's no other medium like this .PERIOD
Now this may not be news to you .PERIOD
But the concept of presence that 's inherent to IM can also exist in other forms of communication .PERIOD
It is n't in too many places yet ,COMMA but hopefully it soon will be .PERIOD
Email Some corporate products ,COMMA such as Microsoft 's Live Communications Server ,COMMA begin to merge email and an IM-like presence ,COMMA but as far as I know ,COMMA there 's no true presence-based email program available to consumers and small businesses .PERIOD
I 've actually been berating email software vendors for a while for not creating an easy-to-use option that lets users see if the person who just sent them email is still around to receive a reply or a phone call or an IM .PERIOD
There are interesting third-party solutions ,COMMA though ,COMMA that do this .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA Convoq 's ASAP allows you to embed a presence indicator in your email or on your Web site .PERIOD
ASAP is designed to help you set up online meetings ,COMMA which is Convoq 's main business ,COMMA but communicating presence is a great feature on its own .PERIOD
Yahoo 's online mail also has a presence indicator .PERIOD
Of course ,COMMA the big social challenge with email and presence would be managing privacy .PERIOD
I do n't want every email I send out to signal my availability .PERIOD
But within my company and among my closest friends ,COMMA it 'd be useful .PERIOD
I 'm still surprised there 's no good standard way to do this .PERIOD
Telephone calls Caller ID is a small step towards bringing presence into mobile phones ,COMMA and it shows ,COMMA as does IM ,COMMA that it has the value of transferring personal information before you start communicating in earnest .PERIOD
But caller ID does n't go far enough .PERIOD
Aside from making a phone ring ,COMMA there 's no other way to signal the person you 're calling that you want to talk ,COMMA and more importantly ,COMMA there 's no way for that person to signal back if he or she does n't .PERIOD
A few companies are solving this problem .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA SoloMio has something I call ' super caller ID ' .PERIOD
Given the right technology on both the calling and the called phones ,COMMA SoloMio allows the person receiving the call to send a quick text message back to the caller ,COMMA such as ,COMMA ' Sorry ,COMMA I 'm busy now ,COMMA ' or ,COMMA ' I ca n't talk now but will call you in 10 minutes ' .PERIOD
You can even have a quick text-based dialogue .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA I call you ,COMMA and my caller ID appears on your phone .PERIOD
You select a canned query in reply : ' Is it urgent ?MARK
' I get a menu option to send back ,COMMA ' Yes ' .PERIOD
Then you pick up the phone .PERIOD
This functionality is available today on a few cellular networks .PERIOD
More smart applications Where else can we apply presence ?MARK
If you start to think beyond simple person-to-person communications ,COMMA the possibilities get really interesting .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA start-up NetMesh is developing a platform that enables applications to be aware of the user 's location and that also gives you information about the presence of people around the user .PERIOD
In a medical setting ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the system can automatically display the record of the nearest patient on a doctor 's tablet computer ,COMMA or in a group setting ,COMMA it can ensure that all the medical personnel in a room are ,COMMA by default ,COMMA looking at data about the same patient .PERIOD
Technology freed us ,COMMA first from ploughs and ,COMMA most recently ,COMMA from our desks .PERIOD
But now that we can work anywhere ,COMMA we can be awfully hard to find .PERIOD
It 's time to start making technology smarter about presence .PERIOD
It could make our lives easier and our work more productive .PERIOD

Claude Chabrol 1930 - Present ,COMMA France With his 1958 debut feature ,COMMA Le Beau Serge ,COMMA Chabrol is regarded to have provided the spearhead for the nouvelle vague ( ' new wave ' ) movement in French cinema that would hold under its banner such names as Francois Truffaut ,COMMA Jean-Luc Godard ,COMMA and Louis Malle .PERIOD
It was a term the directors liked to use for themselves ,COMMA but in fact their approaches varied sufficiently for the term to have a conveniently broad meaning .PERIOD
As Chabrol put it : " There is no new wave ,COMMA only the sea .PERIOD
" After the mixed critical and commercial reception of early efforts - such as The Cousins ,COMMA Les Bonnes Femmes ,COMMA Ophelia - Chabrol turned to more marketable offerings such as the spy caper The Tiger Likes Fresh Blood and Second World war yarn La Ligne de Demarcation .PERIOD
At the end of the 1960s he returned to more serious territory ,COMMA but in the 70s and 80s produced films of variable quality - The Twist ,COMMA Violette ,COMMA The Story of Women - and 1991's Madam Bovary is a rather lifeless adaptation .PERIOD
His frequent treatments of the subjects of murder ,COMMA obsession ,COMMA sex and infidelity - Wedding in Blood ,COMMA This Man Must Die ,COMMA Blood Relatives ,COMMA L'Enfer ,COMMA Merci Pour le Chocolat ( far less sickly than it sounds ) - have earned Chabrol the reputation as something of a French Hitchcock .PERIOD

Monday ,COMMA 13 December 2004 Walk-in centres must attract men The Forum has come up with some ideas to make walk-in centres ,COMMA which are increasingly popular with the government ,COMMA more attractive to men .PERIOD
' We have raised with Health Minister John Hutton how new NHS walk-in centres might more effectively tackle men’s health issues ,COMMA ' said MHF director Peter Baker .PERIOD
' We believe that the centres have the potential to encourage many men who would otherwise not seek help from their GP to do so ,COMMA or to seek help sooner.PERIOD ' To ensure that the new ,COMMA and existing ,COMMA walk-in centres maximize their potential for providing healthcare for men ,COMMA the Forum has proposed : a marketing campaign aimed at men specifically ; a particular effort to attract men who are socio-economically disadvantaged ,COMMA for instance through large local employers of manual/clerical workers – and also by outreach services to specific venues ( eg.PERIOD local pubs ,COMMA betting offices ,COMMA barbers’ shops ,COMMA workplaces ,COMMA etc ) ; that walk-in centres are encouraged to participate in National Men’s Health Week from June 13-19th 2005 focusing on men and weight/obesity ; careful monitoring of the demographics of service users and that service evaluations take gender fully into account ; that the lessons of the walk-in centres are applied to traditional GP provision where appropriate .PERIOD
The Forum has also reiterated its long-standing concern that men are reluctant users of GP services and that GP services themselves have done little to encourage men to attend .PERIOD
' We are concerned that the new GMS contract ,COMMA which is leading to a reduction in out-of-hours services by GPs ,COMMA including Saturday morning clinics ,COMMA may well have a further negative effect on men’s use of primary care ,COMMA ' said Peter Baker .PERIOD

Bowel Cancer Bowel cancer ( also called colorectal or colon cancer ) information from My Pharmacy UK Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK with 30,COMMA000 new cases every year ,COMMA and about 1 in 20 of us can expect to get it at some point in our life .PERIOD
Bowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK with 16,COMMA000 people dying from it every year ,COMMA so it 's something worth knowing about and taking seriously ,COMMA as it is almost completely preventable by leading a healthier life .PERIOD
Bowel cancer affects mostly older people ,COMMA with 90 % of cases in the over 50's ,COMMA but it will have started to slowly grow many years earlier ,COMMA so young to middle age is the time to prevent it .PERIOD
Most bowel cancer is caused by the ' western diet ' .PERIOD
There is 20 times less bowel cancer in China and Japan than there is in America ,COMMA but if someone moves to America the family acquires the national level within a generation due to their change in diet .PERIOD
Bowel cancer is increasing by about 1 % a year but if caught early there is a good chance of survival ,COMMA so seeing your doctor if there are any early signs is very important .PERIOD
Leaving things too late reduces the chance of survival .PERIOD
The early signs of bowel cancer to look out for are - Blood or mucus in the stools Becoming constipated or getting diarrhoea ,COMMA which does not go away Losing weight without any explanation Pain in the abdomen or bottom Having to strain to pass a motion Feeling a lump in the abdomen Blood in the stools can be seen as fresh red blood on your toilet paper ,COMMA or in the toilet .PERIOD
This indicates bleeding near to the end of your bowel .PERIOD
Bleeding higher up the bowel can be more difficult to see as the blood is mixed in with the faeces ,COMMA and has had time to clot .PERIOD
This is why a chemical test is used for detection .PERIOD
This is called a faecal occult blood test ( FOB Test ) ,COMMA which you can also buy yourself .PERIOD
Because early detection is important this is one of the Department of Health 's targets ,COMMA so there will be the first phase of a national screening campaign in England starting in April 2006 ,COMMA with men and women aged 60 to 69 invited to take part .PERIOD
Those eligible will be sent a home test kit and asked to scrape small sample of faeces onto the test card and send it back to the lab for testing .PERIOD
If you are over 70 years old you can ask for a test .PERIOD
The lab will use a chemical test for blood in the sample ,COMMA and let you know if this is positive ,COMMA as this is one of the early signs of bowel cancer .PERIOD
If blood is found in the sample ,COMMA then a second test is sent .PERIOD
About 2 out of every 100 people tested are expected to have both results show positive ,COMMA and they will be asked to go for further tests .PERIOD
However it is estimated that only 1 in 20 people who go for further tests have bowel cancer ,COMMA as most cases of blood being found in your stools are due to haemorrhoids ( piles ) ,COMMA or to other bowel problems such as diverticulitis ,COMMA ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's Disease ,COMMA which can then be treated .PERIOD
Note that a negative result could happen when you do have bowel cancer ,COMMA and it just is n't bleeding when the test is done ,COMMA so you should not ignore the early signs just because your test is negative .PERIOD
Recommended Book - Click here for more details Coping with Bowel Cancer It is hoped to save 2,COMMA000 lives a year with this faecal occult blood screening test ( FOB Test ) ,COMMA by detecting bowel cancer earlier ,COMMA and also raising awareness of it 's existence ,COMMA and the signs to look out for ,COMMA so that more people will seek help earlier .PERIOD
However ,COMMA earlier screening trials have only shown a reduction in mortality of 15 % ,COMMA not a lot to show for all this effort !EXCL
So do n't rely on this screening and think that all is well .PERIOD
Concentrate on the fact that 90 % of bowel cancer is cause by poor diet ,COMMA and this is completely under your control .PERIOD
Other people at risk of developing bowel cancer are anyone suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's Disease .PERIOD
Around 5-10 % of people who get bowel cancer have a family history of the disease ,COMMA and it usually appears before the age of 45 .PERIOD
These people should be especially aware of early signs of the disease ,COMMA and use screening tests as recommended by their doctor .PERIOD
Prevent bowel cancer by looking after your bowels .PERIOD
In simple terms eat food with a high fibre content ,COMMA which stays in the bowel as bulk ,COMMA and moves everything through more quickly .PERIOD
Highly refined and processed foods have less bulk and pass more slowly through the gut .PERIOD
The slower your food passes through you ,COMMA the more chance there is for cancer forming chemicals to be produced ,COMMA damaging small areas of the gut ,COMMA which can become cancerous .PERIOD
Red meat and animal fat can produce chemicals that do this ,COMMA so limit the amount of red meat and saturated fats you eat .PERIOD
Exercise regularly to keep the gut moving ,COMMA and help your food go down .PERIOD
Being overweight puts extra pressure on the gut and slows your food down .PERIOD
How to prevent bowel cancer - Eat plenty of fibre Exercise regularly Lose excess weight Eat less red meat & saturated fat Look after your nutrition Eat plenty of fibre .PERIOD
All fibre is good for the gut ,COMMA as it moves things through quickly ,COMMA but there are two types of fibre which act differently .PERIOD
Insoluble fibre ( wheat bran and whole grains ) is believed to absorb cancer causing chemicals produced in the gut ,COMMA and decrease the risk of bowel cancer .PERIOD
Soluble fibre ( fruit ,COMMA vegetables ,COMMA beans and pulses ) form a thick gel which lubricates the bowel walls and feeds the healthy bacteria in the lower bowel .PERIOD
So make sure you get at least your five portions of fruit and vegetables each day .PERIOD
Ensure a regular daily intake of green vegetables ,COMMA particularly brassicas ( cabbage ,COMMA broccoli ,COMMA sprouts or cauliflower ) .PERIOD
Recent studies have also shown that specific chemicals in vegetables ,COMMA for example the isothiocyanates ,COMMA which give brassicas their characteristic pungent taste ,COMMA might be especially protective against cancer .PERIOD
Exercise regularly .PERIOD
Studies have shown that the risk of bowel cancer can be reduced by as much as 50 % in people who exercise regularly .PERIOD
This does n't have to be anything too energetic ,COMMA as walking ,COMMA gardening ,COMMA and anything that gets you just a little out of breath really helps .PERIOD
It is thought to affect hormone levels and increase your metabolic rate ,COMMA and help the bowel to get rid of waste more quickly .PERIOD
Loosing excess weight improves your life and your bowels ,COMMA especially when combined with the healthy eating and exercise .PERIOD
Sounds familiar ?MARK
This is just one of the reasons you should be doing it .PERIOD
Eat less red meat & saturated fat and eat more fish .PERIOD
Ideally eat red meat no more than once a week,COMMAas they produce cancer causing chemicals while being digested ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA avoid burnt meat ,COMMA such as barbeques ,COMMA which already contains cancer-promoting chemicals called cyclic amines .PERIOD
Fish and white meat are much better .PERIOD
Look after your nutrition .PERIOD
Some studies have shown the beneficial effects of taking multivitamin & mineral supplements ,COMMA and vitamin C ,COMMA vitamin E ,COMMA folic acid ,COMMA selenium and calcium have been singled out as being the most important .PERIOD

Casualty - every episode of which plays like a politically correct disaster movie - is one of the most downright entertaining shows on British television .PERIOD
This article attempts to look at the programme 's content and structure to discover what makes it so enjoyable .PERIOD
Casualty has become the slickest example yet of a particular TV genre ( and a BBC-dominated one ) : the ' institutional ' drama series of which Z Cars ,COMMA Angels ,COMMA Juliet Bravo etc.PERIOD were all examples .PERIOD
This genre can be defined by its setting ,COMMA by the way its self-contained and ongoing plots operate ,COMMA by its relationship to ideas of ' realism ' ,COMMA and by its concern with social and ethical issues of the day .PERIOD
1.PERIOD Structure One of the first things the viewer notices about Casualty is that each episode moves very fast .PERIOD
Each 50 minute episode consists of around 50 scenes ,COMMA with ( usually ) three major plots plus a couple of self-contained sub-plots and still more sub- plots which develop between episodes to reward regular viewing .PERIOD
As an example ,COMMA here 's what goes on in the episode ' Tender Loving Care ' : Major Plots : A.PERIOD An elderly man collapses in a synagogue .PERIOD
He 's saved by staff on Holby Hospital 's accident and emergency ward ,COMMA but afterwards his wife - a stroke victim - collapses and dies .PERIOD
B.PERIOD A boy being bullied on a school trip collapses from sickle cell disease .PERIOD
The A&E ( Accident and Emergency ) team manage to revive him .PERIOD
C.PERIOD A man deliberately self-induces an asthma attack to keep his estranged wife with him .PERIOD
A hospital blunder leads to him being given the wrong medicine .PERIOD
He intends to sue ,COMMA but his wife stops him by threatening to reveal that he 's been assaulting her .PERIOD
Sub-Plots This Episode : A.PERIOD A homeless woman is stopped from sleeping in the A&E ward ,COMMA and turns out to have been stealing its charity boxes .PERIOD
B.PERIOD The reception staff get into trouble for ordering pizzas for patients .PERIOD
Sub-Plots Continuing Between Episodes : A.PERIOD Duffy ( the ward sister ) goes for a biopsy examination and is asked to return for more tests .PERIOD
B.PERIOD A nurse ,COMMA Sandra ,COMMA continues her awkward romantic relationship with the irascible consultant Julian .PERIOD
C.PERIOD Receptionist Norma becomes increasingly worried about her elderly mother ,COMMA with whom she lives .PERIOD
For the regular viewer ,COMMA part of the pleasure of watching Casualty is in watching the regular formula unfold .PERIOD
In the first 20-25 minutes ,COMMA the narrative interest is focussed on what accident is going to befall the characters ( often played by well-known TV faces ) who have been introduced in this episode .PERIOD
In this episode ,COMMA for example ,COMMA we start to guess that the boy Ben is going to collapse from sickle cell disease ,COMMA and we can see disaster looming when the staff are distracted from treating the asthmatic Adam .PERIOD
The remaining 25-30 minutes are generally spent resolving each accident or crisis .PERIOD
Normally ,COMMA we can expect an episode to contain three emergencies ,COMMA at least one of which will end in death .PERIOD
It 's not unusual for the show to end with one patient still fighting for life .PERIOD
The disparate plots are often linked by having scenes change their subject in mid-flow ,COMMA so that ( as in Hill Street Blues ) the camera will follow one character or group and then pick up on a different character as their paths cross .PERIOD
Yet the fact that Casualty runs to formula does n't diminish the suspense .PERIOD
On the contrary ,COMMA it increases the tension for the viewer ,COMMA since we know that at least one of this week 's characters is not going to make it to the end alive - and we want to know who and why .PERIOD
2.PERIOD Characters Casualty ' s paradigmatic structure .PERIOD
Soap opera critics have talked about the paradigmatic nature of their genre : we enjoy the show more if we know the characters ' history and can relate occurrences in the story with a network of past experiences and relationships .PERIOD
Something similar happens in Casualty ,COMMA which builds elements of the soap opera into essentially self-contained episodes .PERIOD
There are 10 main characters in the programme 's 1992-93 season ,COMMA besides a couple who appear occasionally .PERIOD
( A checklist : Charlie ,COMMA Duffy ,COMMA Ash ,COMMA Sandra ,COMMA Norma ,COMMA Rob ,COMMA Max ,COMMA Josh ,COMMA Jane and Julian ,COMMA who was re-placed by Mike in mid-series.PERIOD ) We are given an insight into the private lives of a couple of characters per episode : Charlie 's fight with alcoholism and his unhappy relationships ; Duffy 's affair and engagement ,COMMA and her worries over a smear test ; Julian and Sandra 's ill-fated affair ,COMMA etc.PERIOD The show rewards regular viewers by building up a soap opera style paradigm of relationships .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA in the ' Tender Loving Care ' episode ,COMMA when the receptionist Norma consoles an elderly man about the death of his wife ,COMMA she tells him he should be glad she did n't linger for years like some people .PERIOD
The scene means more to regular viewers because we know Norma has an aged mother to care for - a situation which has been affecting her life and her work throughout the series .PERIOD
A side effect of this paradigmatic structure is that the show does n't depend on any one character .PERIOD
It 's already survived the departure of several of its most popular personnel ,COMMA including one played by Oscar winner Brenda Fricker ,COMMA and would probably be able to carry on even if Derek Thompson ( Charlie ) should leave ,COMMA because other characters are being groomed for succession .PERIOD
Actors need the series more than it needs them .PERIOD
3.PERIOD ' Realism ' People often praise Casualty for being �realistic� or criticise it for being �unrealistic� .PERIOD
Holby ( its fictitious setting ) is clearly based on Bristol ( where the show is shot ) ; the series often draws its plot ideas from the headlines ; and publicity is always keen to stress the authenticity of the medical scenes .PERIOD
But the insistence on using the word realism tells us more about British critics ' obsession with that word than about the programme itself .PERIOD
Plainly ,COMMA an episode of Casualty is n't representative of reality on an A&E ward - otherwise its running time would be largely taken up by people waiting to be treated for sprains and zip fastener injuries .PERIOD
Casualty makes exciting drama precisely because it depicts incidents which are atypical in an A&E ward : squash players impaled on their rackets ,COMMA farmers whose feet have been chopped off by their machinery ,COMMA hunt saboteurs trampled by horses and children crushed in ram-raids ,COMMA for example .PERIOD
But the programme 's medical authenticity is a vital part of the viewer 's enjoyment ,COMMA because it presents us with an endurance test .PERIOD
We like to watch its gory moments without flinching because it somehow enables us to feel we 've seen something horrible and conquered our squeamishness .PERIOD
The series depends on convincing special effects ,COMMA otherwise this part of its appeal -based on the viewer 's faith that the gory moments are depicted accurately - would be lost .PERIOD
4.PERIOD The liberal view Each episode of Casualty raises a host of political ,COMMA social and medical issues .PERIOD
To take the ' Tender Loving Care ' episode as an example again ,COMMA the issues dealt with here are : Domestic violence Homelessness Bullying Under-staffing of the NHS The dangers of ' hooking ' patients on prescription drugs .PERIOD
The need for women to have prompt smear tests The ethics of suing hospitals for their mistakes .PERIOD
Another episode ,COMMA ' Body and Soul ' explores blood sports ( taking care to feature ' good ' and ' bad huntsmen ) ,COMMA rape ( along with the problems involved with reporting it to the police ) and the ethics of non-violent protest versus direct action .PERIOD
Like other shows in whose footsteps it follows ,COMMA Casualty adopts a liberal/left of centre political position .PERIOD
The series depicts the problems created by the NHS reforms ( Holby Hospital has become an NHS trust ) ,COMMA yet union militancy is usually ruled out as a solution : Charlie struggles on under the new management but has to deal with complaints from the more political union rep Ash .PERIOD
The show 's attention to social issues was demonstrated in the last episode of the 1992-93 season ,COMMA ' Boiling Point ' ,COMMA and it would be almost impossible to discuss the series without mentioning the furore surrounding this edition .PERIOD
Re-scheduled to go out after the 9pm watershed ,COMMA the episode was the subject of hundreds of complaints ,COMMA and the outcry prompted a disgraceful climb down from the BBC ,COMMA which said the programme had " gone too far " .PERIOD
The plot had a gang of thugs setting fire to the hospital ,COMMA and the complainants said it could have prompted copycat attacks .PERIOD
Setting aside the fact that a similar incident had already occurred in reality ,COMMA this knee-jerk response to violence on TV shows once more the Mary Whitehouse lobby 's assumption of a hypodermic model of audience response : the complainants think potential yobs would not only be at home on a Saturday night watching Casualty ,COMMA but would be tempted to try burning down their local hospital .PERIOD
Yet the ' Boiling Point ' episode was an instant TV classic .PERIOD
It tackled some of the most important issues of the 1990s : the lawlessness of Tory Britain ,COMMA the public belief that the police ca n't help and the ethics of vigilante action .PERIOD
And it worked all this into a hugely exciting thriller which had a hospital under siege ,COMMA patients dying on the hospital forecourt ,COMMA and a regular character ( Rob ) being badly injured in a disaster .PERIOD
Despite its serious treatment of important issues ,COMMA the protesters could see nothing except the fact that violence took place on screen .PERIOD
The BBC 's lily livered response - and reports that the producers have been told to tone down the next series - may mean the 1993-94 series of Casualty is more timid .PERIOD
That would be a great loss to television .PERIOD
Postscript Nearly ten years later the BBC is still producing Casualty and it has bred a spin-off series ,COMMA Holby City .PERIOD
Meanwhile ITV has produced a rival series A & E ,COMMA and there is the US series ER .PERIOD
ER �s fast pace and action has had a big influence on the British hospital dramas .PERIOD
Notes The episodes referred to are from the 1992-93 series of Casualty ,COMMA produced by Geraint Morris for BBC Bristol .PERIOD

Script editors : Sally Haynes ,COMMA Laura Mackie .PERIOD

The Final Kent Years brings to a close Ace 's three-volume presentation of the complete 60s and 70s recordings waxed by Lowell Fulson for the Bihari brothers ' Los Angeles-based Kent and Big Town labels .PERIOD
Black Nights ( CDCHD 804 ) traced this memorable alliance from its 1964 beginning with those well-crafted early blues singles .PERIOD
There was much contribution from manager-songwriter Ferdinand " Fats " Washington together with West Coast R&B icon Maxwell Davis ,COMMA who was in his final glory as arguably LA 's greatest studio force in his field .PERIOD
The ' Tramp ' Years ( CDCHD 755 ) continued through Lowell 's rejuvenation on the charts as a funkster and link in the musical food chain to hip-hop .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA The Final Kent Years reprises Lowell 's last two albums for the family combine ,COMMA his last Kent single and three more recently unearthed tunes .PERIOD
The first major component of the set is the " Now !EXCL
" LP ,COMMA which made a typical Bihari trek through a series of cheapie labels after its Kent debut .PERIOD
This album largely takes us to the end of Lowell 's main run with the company in 1968 .PERIOD
Though " Now !EXCL
" attracted no great notice at the time ,COMMA and it was Lowell 's only Kent LP not framed around a hit ,COMMA it holds up very well .PERIOD
The brassy ,COMMA ornate tracks have energetic performances by Lowell as big as the orchestrations-.PERIOD-the stripped-down outings show Lowell close to his roots with frequent gospel tinges-.PERIOD-his take on the covers is fresh and spirited .PERIOD
Throughout ,COMMA the recently resurgent Arthur Adams 's outstanding input as a guitarist ,COMMA and as co-author of the shuffling dance anthem Push Me ( probably a reflection of Adams 's time on the Dallas " Push club " circuit that spawned Anson Funderburgh ) ,COMMA takes the proceedings to another level .PERIOD
Five worthy loose ends from the period ,COMMA including the last Kent single ,COMMA provide a point of departure for the nine-year gap ( with stints at Jewel and Granite ) before Lowell 's return to the Bihari fold .PERIOD
" Lovemaker " was the one-off product of a February 1978 outing under the auspices of indie vet George Mottola .PERIOD
It originally appeared ,COMMA like " Now !EXCL
" ,COMMA to no discernible fanfare ,COMMA on Big Town .PERIOD
While probably a low budget project of modest pretensions and not an essential in many LP piles ,COMMA " Lovemaker " is nonetheless a good ,COMMA solid ,COMMA straight-ahead blues excursion .PERIOD
The band is basic and Lowell gets a goodly share of the guitar spotlight .PERIOD
Amid some standards which underscore Lowell 's longtime affinity for Tampa Red ,COMMA Lowell 's originals tend toward midtempo blues ,COMMA notably Bending Like A Willow Tree ( covered by Albert Collins ) and My Mind Is Trying To Leave Me ,COMMA attributed to Lowell and his good friend Percy Mayfield and also revived by Collins .PERIOD
Lowell went on to cut a number of fine albums for American ,COMMA Canadian and European labels before his death at Long Beach CA on 7 March 1999 .PERIOD
With these three Ace CDs ,COMMA we have his 1964-78 Bihari catalogue to revisit with unprecedented depth ,COMMA sound quality and convenience .PERIOD

The biggest challenge in Monterrey is the heat .PERIOD
It is always very hot and humid .PERIOD
In the last two years ,COMMA the temperature has been around 115� F ( 46�C ) ,COMMA and the heat in the car makes this race very demanding .PERIOD
You have to keep hydrated during the race ,COMMA but you also have to be physically prepared before the race .PERIOD
On race day ,COMMA I lose almost eight pounds of fluid .PERIOD
The track itself is tight with a lot of good corners ,COMMA but little tyre grip ,COMMA so there 's a lot of hanging on because you 're sliding around quite a bit .PERIOD
That means you 're on the brakes a little more and playing with the controls to handle the car .PERIOD
When you 're on cold tyres ,COMMA everything steps up a bit because you have even less feeling .PERIOD
The lack of grip is caused by a couple of things .PERIOD
First ,COMMA the type of asphalt on the track has less grip than other surfaces and ,COMMA second ,COMMA the track is not used that often ,COMMA so it has more dust on it .PERIOD
The tyre rubber we lay down during race weekend does help to create grip over the three days.PERIOD However ,COMMA that creates a lot more set -up challenges ,COMMA as the grip changes from Friday to Sunday .PERIOD
Because of the low grip ,COMMA the set-up on the car is critical in Monterrey .PERIOD
The corners seem to run longer on a low-grip track ,COMMA so you have to really be able to communicate with your engineer how to get as much grip as possible .PERIOD
I qualified third here in 2004 and second in 2005 ,COMMA so I 'm hoping to continue that trend in 2006 .PERIOD

Sheila Leeds PRESIDENT'S REMARKS Since our last Journal there have been some changes in the administration of the Society and in the running of our meetings .PERIOD
Firstly ,COMMA Dominic Johnson-Bland ,COMMA who for some time now has been running the Society 's bookstall and publications/fiche ordering ,COMMA has taken on a new role as Family History Research Advisor .PERIOD
The Council of the Society believes this will be a useful service that can be offered to members ,COMMA both postal and at meetings ,COMMA and Dominic ,COMMA with her wealth of experience ,COMMA is ideally suited for this position .PERIOD
Please note that this service is for advice only ,COMMA for example on what to search ; it is not a service to do actual research for members .PERIOD
Secondly ,COMMA the bookstall in turn has been taken over by Sheila Greenall ,COMMA who already runs the Society 's postal service for publications and fiche .PERIOD
Sheila is also taking over the standing order service which until recently was run by Mary Butler .PERIOD
We would like to thank Dominic ,COMMA Sheila and Mary for their valuable help ,COMMA and we hope members who may be stuck with their research might like to contact Dominic either by post or at meetings .PERIOD
You never know ,COMMA there could be something else to try that you had never thought of !EXCL
Peter Hammond APRIL MEETING RECOLLECTIONS OF A BEVIN BOY by Les Mitten In the early war years ,COMMA over 36,COMMA000 miners left the industry for better paid work .PERIOD
The Government decided it needed 40,COMMA000 more miners but despite asking service men to opt for this reserved occupation ,COMMA little impact was made on the numbers needed .PERIOD
In September 1943 an appeal was made to Head Teachers of relevant schools but this seemed to be ignored ,COMMA and so on December 1943 Ernest Bevin masterminded a scheme whereby a ballot took place to put men called up for Services into the mines instead .PERIOD
The only exceptions were men accepted for flying duties in the RAF or Fleet Air Arm ,COMMA men accepted for work in submarines and men on a shortlist of highly skilled occupations required for Service trades .PERIOD
Each month Mr Bevin 's secretary put 10 digits into a hat and ,COMMA for a period of approximately 20 months ,COMMA two of these numbers were drawn out and all those men whose National Service Registration Number ended with that digitwere directed into Coal Mining without exception .PERIOD
Mr Mitten 's number came out of the hat and he was sent a letter directing him to the mines at Creswell .PERIOD
Most Bevin Boys were put into hostels but some lodged with families ,COMMA which in Mr Mitten 's case was a family in Mansfield .PERIOD
After Creswell Colliery came New Hucknall Colliery at Huthwaite ,COMMA working on the screens ,COMMA picking out stones etc.PERIOD This was followed by emptying ash waggons by hand shovel onto the slag heaps .PERIOD
All a far cry from the teleprinter work which he had been trained to do by the Post Office prior to ' call up ' .PERIOD
Mr Mitten 's career then followed an unusual path as the Colliery Doctor decided he was not Al because of his eyesight and refused to let him work underground .PERIOD
The Colliery wanted to get rid of him but were not allowed to do so .PERIOD
Eventually he was made Assistant Timekeeper .PERIOD
This meant going down the pit at least three times a week for various meetings and did enable him to develop a good working knowledge of the mines despite the fact that he still yearned to be in the Forces .PERIOD
Eventually at 19 years he became the Colliery Timekeeper ,COMMA although most of the Bevin Boys did work on the haulage system underground .PERIOD
When a new Colliery Manager was appointed he decided that he wanted a male secretary and Mr Mitten was appointed Colliery Manager 's Clerk ,COMMA which meant he was able to observe all the changes in 1947 when the NCB was established ,COMMA These changes ,COMMA however ,COMMA did not affect the Bevin Boys immediately as they could not ask for their pre-war jobs as could demobbed Servicemen .PERIOD
The Bevin Boys were not covered by the laws of the land and originally when they were demobbed they were not given travel warrants ,COMMA suits etc.PERIOD but this was eventually amended .PERIOD
One of the popular misconceptions was that many Bevin Boys were conscientious objectors but in fact only six such objectors opted for the mines .PERIOD
Mr Mitten admitted that with hindsight it was not such a bad life although they were all disappointed to be selected for the collieries even though this selection probably saved the lives of many .PERIOD
A few of the Bevin Boys were injured but none ever received a pension as they were regarded as civilians .PERIOD
The last of the Bevin Boys were demobbed in 1948 with very few opting to stay in the industry .PERIOD
Mr Mitten 's release came through in August 1947 ,COMMA but he had agreed to stay on until October of that year to finish a project on statistics with which he had become involved .PERIOD
Report by Pauline Chettle MAY MEETING THE DUKERIES AND SHERWOOD FOREST by David Ottewell Mr Ottewell 's talk took the form of a gentle stroll around the Dukeries and Sherwood Forest ,COMMA including its villages ,COMMA illustrated by slides of some of his hundreds of postcards of Nottinghamshire .PERIOD
He began by showing photographs of the Forest as we think of it and then extended outwards to include all the villages which used to lie within its boundaries .PERIOD
Many of these have changed very little over the years and were instantly recognisable .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA Mr Ottewell showed slides of both the inside and outside of the important big houses which were built in that part of the Forest known as The Dukeries .PERIOD
It served to remind us all of our fast disappearing county heritage and the joy of old postcards in bringing it to life .PERIOD
Report by Pauline Chettle NOTES AND QUERIES AND HELP WANTED AND OFFERED Please keep your entries as short and concise as possible and laid out in the same manner as below .PERIOD

He died in 1836 and was buried at Papplewickk 18 July 1836 aged 48 .PERIOD
At the time of his marriage he was shown as " of this parish " .PERIOD
