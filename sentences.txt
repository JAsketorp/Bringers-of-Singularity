Home Holidays Walking Spain Hidden Gem of the Canaries Hidden Gem of the Canaries The green valleys of La Gomera From the peak of Garajonay , the highest point of the central plateau , mountains alternate with lush green valleys to the coast , where steep cliffs drop away to the glittering blue waters below .
Deep ravines , ancient tropical forests and groves of palm trees lend a special enchantment to this pretty island , a secret paradise for walkers .
Discover the best of this magical island -- ancient forests , peaks reaching into the clouds , lush ravines ( barrancos ) and beaches of black sand -- on a marvellous holiday full of contrasts and highly rewarding walking .
To access the best walks , taxis are required at the start of three days ; we include these on itinerant walking days ( days 4 and 6 ) but not for the linear walk from Vallehermoso , giving you the freedom to decide whether to walk or simply relax at your hotel .
On most walks , you descend more than you ascend , but they are very much of a grade 2-3 standard , satisfying and enjoyable .
Nights : 7 Grade : 2-3 Terrain : cliffs , sub-tropical forest , steep-sided ravines Hotels : two inns ; one 4-star parador Meals : breakfast each day , dinner on 5 nights , 2 picnics Climate : ' winter ' on the Canary Islands is pleasantly warm .
The table below gives the average temperatures for La Gomera ( in �C ) .
Temperatures will of course vary according to altitude .
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 16 16 18 20 24 26 28 30 30 25 18 16 Hotel Tamahuche Terrace view , Hotel Tamahuche Hermigua square Starting point : Hotel Tamahuche ( inn ) , Vallehermoso .
Converted from a 19th-century townhouse , this pleasant hotel promises warm hospitality from your charming and enthusiastic host .
You dine at the hotel 's restaurant in the town square , a short stroll away .
Day 1 : our suggested circular route is a great introduction to the landscapes of La Gomera .
You ascend through a terraced , palm-clad barranco ( ravine ) to a hermitage , from where you can see the coast and even the island of Tenerife in the distance in clear weather , then follow the ridge to another hermitage .
From here , you zigzag downhill towards the coast and return to Vallehermoso along a quiet country lane .
( 14km , 5hrs ) Accommodation : Hotel Tamahuche , as above .
Day 2 : for a very varied walk , take a taxi for the 60-minute journey to the viewpoint at the hermitage at Igualero ( approx E30 , pay locally ) .
The route takes in four of the villages that face the south-western coast , all connected by mule paths which cling dramatically to the slopes above deep barrancos .
On clear days there are good views of La Fortaleza , a strangely-shaped outcrop not unlike a fortress ( hence the name ) , and later of the island of El Hierro .
The second part of the walk leads uphill through the enchanting laurel woods that coat the backbone of the National Park before descending steeply towards the northern coast along a series of stepped pathways .
The day ends with a panoramic ridge walk back to Vallehermoso .
If you would prefer a shorter walk , you could start from a different point along the route .
( 22km , 7hrs ) Accommodation : Hotel Tamahuche , as above .
Day 3 : the day begins with a taxi ride ( included ) to the centre of the island .
On a clear day , it is well worth ascending to the viewing platform at the top of the Alto de Garajonay ( 1,497 metres ) for a marvellous 360-degree panorama , a detour which will add less than an hour to your day .
Otherwise , your walk is almost all downhill , taking you first through lovely woods and over streams , then descending along an ancient cobbled path through a dramatic gorge with a narrow waterfall to Hermigua .
( 12km , 4hrs ) Accommodation : Ibo Alfaro ( inn ) , Hermigua .
Converted from an attractive 150-year-old manor house , the Ibo Alfaro is run by the hospitable Ina and enjoys sweeping views from its hillside location .
Your stay is on a bed and breakfast basis ; we provide taxis into Hermigua where you can take your pick of the restaurants .
Day 4 : our circular walk climbs out of the valley to explore the starker landscapes above Hermigua , which contrast greatly with the green of the banana plantations and the blue of the sea below .
You pass an abandoned hamlet with views across the water towards Tenerife , and then follow a cliff-hugging coastal path to the pretty cove of Caleta , where you can enjoy swim in good weather before completing the final leg back to Hermigua .
( 16km , 5.5hrs ) Accommodation : Ibo Alfaro , as above .
Day 5 : after a taxi transfer ( included ) , you set off along a ridge between two barrancos to reach a high abandoned plain dotted with ruined houses .
You cross the plain and descend into a deep , barren ravine dotted with cacti to reach the coast .
Here , you follow the coastal path , descending and ascending as you cross the mouths of several broad gullies .
In good weather , you can shorten the walk by half by catching the boat to San Sebasti�n ( pay locally ) , thus gaining a different perspective of La Gomera 's dramatic coast .
( 16km , 6.5hrs ) Accommodation : Parador ( 4* ) , San Sebasti�n .
Built in local style , the parador exudes elegance .
The excellent facilities include an outdoor pool set in pleasant gardens .
Day 6 : choose between a relaxing day exploring San Sebasti�n , the island 's capital , or a final walk towards the distinctive triangular peak of Jarag�n ( 624 metres ) that rewards you in clear weather with sweeping views over the island .
You return along the same route .
( 11km , 5hrs ) Accommodation : Parador , as above .
Recommendations for extra nights : to extend your holiday , we recommend that you stay in the parador on Tenerife to get a feel for another of the islands in the archipelago and make the most of your time in the Canary Islands .
The parador ( not available 15 Dec-15 Feb ) makes an make excellent base for walking on the slopes of Spain 's highest peak .
Alternatively , spend a week in one of our charming self-catering cottages on La Palma .

Key Issues Arising for from the Civil Partnerships Act September 2005 Has the English House of Bishops ' response to the Government 's recently enacted Civil Partnership legislation put the Church of England in a position where it should be disciplined as the North American Churches have because of their open ordination of active homosexuals and the approval of same-sex partnership rites ?
As the rift between the Anglican global south and Anglo-American Anglicanism becomes deeper , this is a question about which clarity is essential .
If the answer is ' yes ' and a diocesan bishop is not willing to distance himself from the policy , then parish clergy have a duty to distance themselves from such a bishop by declaring themselves to be in ' impaired communion ' .
While affirming historic biblical teaching on marriage , their failure not only to oppose the legislation , but also to allow clergy to enter into Civil Partnerships , means that the House of Bishops has endorsed legislation which creates same sex marriage in all but name .
It is clear that the legislation is intended to create a new social institution which enables and legitimises same sex sexual relationships for the following reasons : a ) The provisions of the Civil Partnership Act mimic marriage .
For example there are prohibited degrees of relationship and one cannot marry if already in a Civil Partnership. b ) The political context has been that of legitimising active homosexual relationships .
For instance , Jacqui Smith MP , Deputy Minister for Women and Equality , claimed that �The Civil Partnership Bill underlines the inherent value of committed same-sex relationships.�(Government Fact Sheet July 2004). c ) Now that the legislation has become law , the agenda to create a new social institution has been revealed in quite unambiguous terms .
Meg Munn , Deputy Equality Minister is reported as saying that �once an anomaly in pensions legislation had been ironed out in five years , there would be no legal difference between civil partnerships and marriage� and �like other couples , civil partners will be able to " marry " in approved venues .
The only discrepancy between a partnership and a marriage will be the way the union is formalized.� ( Daily Telegraph 15th September 2005 ; full article below ). The House of Bishops ' claim that ' The Government has stated that it has no intention of introducing ' same -sex marriage ' .
Civil partnerships are not a form of marriage. ' ( July Statement paragraph 8 ) is clearly wrong .
The kindest interpretation is that the Bishops have been extremely naive .
The House of Bishops ' statement allows clergy to enter into Civil Partnerships on the basis of assurances that they are not in a sexually active relationship .
This is the basis on which they seek to accept the legislation while maintaining doctrinal consistency , but the attempt is deeply implausible because it ignores the church context : i ) Active homosexual relationships have been tolerated in many dioceses for decades so this would be a reversal of existing ' on the ground ' policy. ii ) The discipline is completely unworkable in practice touching as it does on private and intimate behaviour , not to mention the awkwardness of defining what is meant by a ' sexual relationship'. iii ) The Bishop of Worcester has already broken ranks , rejecting the policy of asking for assurances of celibacy and encouraging other bishops to do likewise .
If no discipline is exercised against Peter Selby and others of like mind it will be entirely clear that the Church of England has no will to maintain the biblical and historic nature of marriage even within its own ranks .
It will be de facto in the same position as the North American Churches .
The House of Bishop 's statement includes the comment that the House ' considers that lay people who registered Civil Partnerships ought not to be asked for assurances about the nature of their relationship before being admitted to baptism , confirmation and communion ' .
This is a significant broadening of the boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour for a committed Christian because : a ) Being in a Civil Partnership is no longer deemed relevant to the requirement that those who come to baptism should reject the devil and all rebellion against God , renounce the deceit and corruption of evil , and repent of the sins that separate us from God and neighbour , whereas if the historic teaching of the Bible is truly believed , and given that Civil Partnerships create an institution specifically tailored for those in same-sex relationships , assurances are more not less necessary .
The biblical principle is that we should ' Test everything .
Hold on to the good .
Avoid every kind of evil ' ( 1 Thess .
5:21,22 ) , not sail as close to the wind as possible. b ) Same sex partnerships are seen as belonging to that realm of ethical issues where conscience should be respected , but it is difficult to imagine racism , for example , being so treated .
It is clear that the Bishops collectively have already given up on the idea that biblical teaching on marriage and gender is a fundamental to biblical ethics and authority .
It has been reduced instead to the nature of a guideline and matter for ongoing debate .
The shifts seen in the House of Bishops ' response to the Civil Partnership legislation are instructive in the way they build on and amplify previous departures from biblical standards .
In a climate where confusion has already been created , a clear moral and biblical vision is increasingly difficult to maintain. a ) The principle that candidates for baptism in Civil Partnerships should be accepted with no questions asked about their relationship , despite a context which lead one reasonably to expect that there is a sexual relationship is clearly consistent with the guidance of the earlier House of Bishop 's Report ' Issues in Human Sexuality ' of 1991 which indicated tolerance for lay same sex relationships , but not amongst the clergy. b ) The ' no questions asked ' approach is also justified in regard to those bringing children to baptism on the basis of the 2003 Adoption Act , which was itself eased in its passage through Parliament by the support of the Church of England 's Children 's Society for gay adoption .
Conclusion While it is possible to argue that in terms of words on paper the Church of England has maintained biblical teaching on marriage , the reality is the reverse .
Such a fiction can only be maintained by ignoring the facts of the political and ecclesial context , in summary that : a ) the Civil Partnership Act is a deliberate attempt to create an new social institution of same sex marriage b ) the Bishops of the Church of England continue to tolerate without any effective discipline behaviour which is clearly at odds with its claimed allegiance to historic biblical teaching .
In an increasingly decadent society , the Bishops blur the boundaries between right and wrong and confuse those who are called to fight against the world , the flesh and the devil .
If they cannot any longer shepherd the Church in a godly way , we must look for other shepherds who can , while in the meantime local clergy should conscientiously reject the ministry of those shepherds who are harming the flock .
Charles Raven Footnotes ' The Act closely and exhaustively replicates for Civil Partnerships virtually every provision in law which relates to marriage ' Bishop Michael Scott-Joynt New Directions August 2005 ' A campaign to promote gay " marriages " was launched by the Government yesterday with the assistance of two same-sex couples who are planning to " tie the knot� .
Ministers believe that some in the lesbian and gay community are still unaware of the Civil Partnerships Act , which comes into force on Dec 5. Launching the campaign at Westminster Register Office , Meg Munn , the deputy equality minister , said that , once an anomaly in pensions legislation had been ironed out in five years , there would be no legal difference between civil partnerships and marriage .
Partners will have the same rights as married couples in tax , employment , benefits and housing and , if the relationship breaks down , the courts can rule on the division of property and maintenance payments .
Like other couples , civil partners will be able to " marry " in approved venues .
The only discrepancy between a partnership and a marriage will be the way the union is formalised .
While couples marrying have to recite a set of words , civil partners will be legally " joined " when they sign a register. ' Daily Telegraph 15th September 2005 ' I dare to hope that bishops will find better ways of relating to such couples than seeking assurances , and I believe many of us will .
But , sorry as I am to need to say so , the words we have uttered on this topic will not help either bishops or those to whom they minister .
For the desire of people to enter civil partnerships , and the willingness of the Government to make that possible , represent something far more hopeful than this document makes it appear ' .
Bishop Peter Selby , Church Times , 19th August 2005 .
For Christians , marriage- that is the lifelong union between a man and a woman - remains the proper context for sexual activity .
In its approach to civil partnerships the Church will continue to uphold that standard , to affirm the value of committed , sexually abstinent friendships between people of the same sex and to minister sensitively and pastorally to those Christians who conscientiously decide to order their lives differently .
House of Bihops ' statement on Civil Pternships , para 27 .
The House of Bishops ' statement of December 1991 - Issues in Human Sexuality - which states that ' heterosexuality and homosexuality are not equally congruous with the observed order of Creation or with the insights of revelation as the Church engages with these in the light of her pastoral ministry ' , that the conscientious decision of those who enter into homophile relationships must be respected and that the Church must not ' reject those who sincerely believe it is God 's call to them ' .
Nevertheless , because of ' the distinctive nature of their calling , status and consecration ' the clergy ' cannot claim the liberty to enter into sexually active homophile relationships ' From The House of Bishops Statement on Civil Partnerships , July 2005 para 6 The Adoption Act 2003 allows for couples that are not married , opposite-sex and same-sex , to adopt children .
The Civil Partnership Act includes legislation about children and reflects an expectation that some people who register civil partnerships will have children in their care .
While the House of Bishops recognises many in the Church have reservations about these developments , we believe an unconditional welcome should be given to children in our churches , regardless of the structure of the family in which they are being brought up. ' From The House of Bishops Statement on Civil Partnerships , July 2005 para 24
A nightmare scenario !
Lee is struggling with an assignment on his Leisure and Recreation Course .
So far things have gone well because most of the work has been about fitness training and sport .
However , his latest task is on " Conflicts of interest on Lake Windermere " .
Lee lives in the middle of a city and realises he knows very little about the countryside and even less about Lake Windermere .
He turns to the Internet for help .
He 's delighted to comes across a Web site that seems to offer lots of information about a proposed 10mph speed limit on Lake Windermere .
He notes down lots of details from the site and puts it into his coursework .
He is horrified when his teacher hands him back his assignment and he sees he has failed !
After chatting with his tutor , he realises that the Web site he had used for his essay was produced by a local speedboat operator who is campaigning against the proposed speed limit on Lake Windermere .
As a result , the information available on the site only presented one side of the argument .
Andy Sargentee ( Jeff Bridges ) is a perpetual under-achiever whose get-rich-quick schemes frequently land him in trouble .
Desperate to prove his worth to his teenage son - who is now living with a well-off stepfather - Andy finds inspiration in dirty movies and resolves to make his own amateur porn film with the help of his none-too-bright friends .
But what looks to be an easy prospect on paper quickly proves far more difficult in reality , particularly as finding the right women to appear in the project proves easier said than done .
What we say It 's very rare to find a bad Jeff Bridges film - but The Moguls has to represent one of the most misguided choices of his distinguished career .
Designed as a life-affirming comedy about a small town coming together , the film ends up being a sexist , homophobic mess with a dose of racism thrown in .
It also wastes the talents of a strong support cast , which includes Tim Blake Nelson as a love-struck refrigerator repairman , Ted Danson as a closet gay " womaniser " , William Fichtner and Joe Pantoliano as the town idiots ( the latter is even called Some Idiot ) , and Glenne Headley as a tart with a heart searching for love in all the wrong places .
The Moguls actually boasts quite an intriguing premise , but is so woefully crass that it 's likely to offend rather than inspire anyone who sees it .
Evidence of its desperation to find laughs comes from the number of ways its characters strive to think of new terms for genitalia or sexual positions , while attempts to make its characters seem endearing by highlighting their social awkwardness merely grate .
What 's worse is the film 's consistent ability to turn off viewers with its racist , sexist and homophobic stereotypes .
Women , especially , get a rough deal , appearing as sex objects throughout ( Glenne 's character only agrees to appear in the movie because she has already lost most of her dignity ) , while a trio of black men are cast and then ridiculed because their manhood does n't measure up to scratch .
Ted Danson , meanwhile , has to contend with a script that requires him to throw sexist comments around like confetti while apologising for the fact he is gay .
By the time the film reaches its obvious and banal conclusion , audiences should have become utterly sick of its contrivances .
The overall result is a proper movie stiff .

Research cannot make the decisions for policy makers and others concerned with improving the quality of education in our schools and colleges .
Nor can it by itself bring about change .
However , it can create a better basis for decisions , by providing information and explanation about educational practice and by clarifying and challenging ideas and assumptions .
It is important that every opportunity should be taken to communicate research findings , both inside and outside the Scottish Executive Education Department ( SEED ) .
Moreover , if research is to have the greatest possible impact on policy and practice , the findings need to be presented in an accessible , interesting and attractive form to policy makers , teachers , lecturers , parents and employers .
Interchange aims to further improve the Education Department Research Unit 's dissemination of the findings of research funded by SEED .
We hope you will find that Interchange is long enough to give the flavour of the complexities , subtleties and limitations of a research study but concise enough to give a good feeling for the findings and in some cases to encourage you to obtain the full report .

It 's more of a challenge to get throught the sticky bits and more corners are ' entertaining'. hannu 2 Nov 2005 18:11 Re : Preston 2005 Muddy used to be unfair because of the Turbo 4WD cars out , Adrian tried various " handicaps " etc. Now , no 4WD cars are allowed , so " bring on " a really MUDDY one !

daveleadbetter 2 Nov 2005 20:43 Re : Preston 2005 Tom , I do n't think I 've ever hit a ' soft ' bump on the Preston , though I reckon Issac cleared most them last year whilst airborne and on a mission ... .
.
Here 's hoping for lots and lots and lots and lots of lovely , claggy , slippery Norfolk mud !
jonlawes 2 Nov 2005 20:45 Re : Preston 2005 Ah , now I see the logic .
However as I am knobblyless I think I will be slower and steadier than most !
gavin 2 Nov 2005 21:03 Re : Preston 2005 Your doing the preston with no knobblies !

If youve got any spare cash then at least try & buy 2 for the front driving wheels daveleadbetter 2 Nov 2005 21:23 Re : Preston 2005 I reckon at the minimum you need something like these - http://www.tyresdirectuk.co.uk/xcart/customer/home.php?cat=18 Cheap , quite effective and Preston proven .
Sorted. [ Edited by daveleadbetter - 2 Nov 2005 21:26 ] jonlawes 2 Nov 2005 21:28 Re : Preston 2005 Cheap or not , Its money I do n't have .
I may try scrounging a set from work , but if not I realise its going to be a little interesting .
With a wife and child at home I really ca n't justify spending any more on the car ; all my preparation is having to take place within a month of the event , so the impact on my pocket has been immense .
If anyone has any nearly worn out 155 R13 knobblys then I would be very very interested !
( wow , long shot anyone ?
) jonlawes 2 Nov 2005 21:31 Re : Preston 2005 I suppose a pair wo n't hurt from the place you suggest .
( I can hear my debit card screaming.... ) jonlawes 2 Nov 2005 21:34 Re : Preston 2005 Right , the dirty is done .
That was � 50 I did n't have.... matt 2 Nov 2005 21:35 Re : Preston 2005 Could probably sort you with a couple of old knobblie tyres , if you can collect them from darkest Essex ( Tilbury ) .
For the price of a pint .
Or you could try using running these http://www.tyresdirectuk.co.uk/xcart/customer/home.php?cat=5 16 quid a tyre , i 'll be running these this year , they were very effective in the mud when i tried them , and good on tarmac. matt 2 Nov 2005 21:36 Re : Preston 2005 D'Oh took too long to type my post. daveleadbetter 2 Nov 2005 21:38 Re : Preston 2005 I know the feeling - it would have to happen in December , the most expensive month of the year would n't it....... daveleadbetter 2 Nov 2005 21:41 Re : Preston 2005 My God , went to type a reply and in the time it took , four new posts appear !

I could lie and tell her I was looking at naked ladies but she would never believe me. hammy 3 Nov 2005 18:24 Re : Preston 2005 Jon , You also need a couple of spare tyres .
What sizes do you want bearing in mind clearance of arches .
Between the nutters that post on the website we must be able to muster up enough old knobblies to circle the globe .
I take it you have looked at the photo gallery and seen the state you car will come back in .
Assuming it holds together !

Adrian Gladwin , CoC. hammy 3 Nov 2005 20:50 Re : Preston 2005 A few things are certain .
It will resemble a muddy ball , be twice as heavy as it started and smell of cow dung forever. jonlawes 3 Nov 2005 21:34 Re : Preston 2005 the car was originally bought as a � 300 snotter by my dad to carry the wet dog around in , any smell has to be an improvement over the lingering stench of border collie ... .
I have a spare , but it will just be a normal tire .
My biggest problem is I am a long way from chelmsford ; I live in dorset .
However I have friends in the area who have kindly offered to help me out with some tires , I will just need to find another wheel from somewhere .
Thanks again for your kind help everyone ; I have never been a member of a club that has made me feel this welcome. abmotorsport 3 Nov 2005 22:55 Re : Preston 2005 30 days............. bring it on.............. berkofthecourse 4 Nov 2005 00:36 Re : Preston 2005 Baker , are you really counting the days ?
?

Jon , if nobody has told you this , its a strict requirement that spare tyres are securely fixed in position... together with anything else that might do any damage if floating around - both inside the car and in the boot .
Glad to hear we 're making you feel welcome... actually its a huge joke , we do this to someone every year - on the night we 're all going to point at you and laugh... its great. jonlawes 4 Nov 2005 08:42 Re : Preston 2005 Well I 'll feel at home being pointed and laughed at ; I 'm a teacher !
Thanks for all the advice ; I will ensure everything is secure !
matt 4 Nov 2005 08:47 Re : Preston 2005 For a real talking point in the classroom , and an excuse to talk about rallying rather than teaching is to drive the Preston finishing car to school and park it in the playground , it will get loads of questions from the kids all day .
Did that last year , and got to waffle on about how great the Preston is for hours hannu 4 Nov 2005 09:06 Re : Preston 2005 Even better if it rains - you leave a huge pile of mud where your car was parked matt 4 Nov 2005 09:42 Re : Preston 2005 It did that as well , caretaker did n't see the funny side of this cochapman 4 Nov 2005 10:26 Re : Preston 2005 Jon leactures in Motorsport at a college in Wiltshire .

We are both in the same class , so this help really has been appreciated ; he has even showed me where in the car I need to put the lead ballast and the correct slick tires to use .

Disarmament Diplomacy Issue No. 40 , September - October 1999 Report on Economic Costs of South Asia Arms Race On September 23 , the UN 's annual report on Development in South Asia laid special emphasis on the detrimental socio-economic consequences of sharply increasing military spending .
According to the report : " When the most basic social services are missing in both India and Pakistan , the rising defence burdens in these countries continue to impose prohibitive social and economic costs on their people .
.. .
If the immense costs of conventional weapons and large armies are not already enough , new estimates for maintaining full-scale nuclear arsenals... are expected to run to for India and Pakistan each - at a bare minimum - $ 750 million a year " .

The number of qualifications available in the UK today is far greater than it was twenty years ago .
This is a good thing in that it offers learners and employers a greater range of choice to fit their abilities and needs , but it can be confusing .
The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority ( QCQ ) is the guardian of standards in education and training .
With partners in Wales ( ACCAC ) , Northern Ireland ( CCEA ) and Scotland ( Scottish Qualifications Authority ) , a coherent and transparent national frame of qualifications is being developed to guarantee quality and standards , meeting the full range of needs of learners and those who provide education , employment and training .
Please see our Links Page for contact details for Qualifications Authorities .
The National Qualifications Framework has been set up to help compare vocational and general qualifications and understand what the different levels mean .
It is only a guide : different qualifications measure different things in different ways , so they are not directly comparable .
Now you’re in Year 9 , you’ll be starting to think about which subjects you would like to carry on with , and hopefully take for GCSE .

click here for essential travel ski guides Travel to Brazil with travel insurance from Essential Travel click here for a cheap travel insurance quotation Information on Brazil Brazil is one of the world 's largest countries and its diversity and geography , showcased in the massive and awe-inspiring Amazon jungle , are striking .
Brazil is a tropical paradise of sublime beaches , carnivals , and football , and her dazzling cities embody everything Brazilians love about their culture .
Rio de Janeiro has one the world 's most beautiful settings and is one of the most densely populated places on earth .
This bustling city has the world-famous Copacabana beach and chic Ipanema ; exotic parks and gardens ; excellent museums and art galleries , and unrivalled mountain views of the city .
The Corcovado mountain peak has the statue of Christ the Redeemer at its summit and is the most popular attraction after the beaches in Rio .
Brazilians thrive on dance , drink , beach , sport and sun , and the elaborate carnivals throughout the year are testament to this .
Other highlights include the Tijuca National Park on the steep Serra da Carioca , and Sugar Loaf Mountain .
Not far to the west of Rio is the huge metropolis of S�o Paulo , South America 's largest city .
With a diverse population of immigrants ( mainly descendants from Japanese and Italians ) , intolerable traffic , and an unbeatable nightlife , S�o Paulo is vibrant , to say the least .
Unmissable attractions include the 16th century Pat�o do Col�gio , the Museu de Arte de S�o Paulo , and the baroque Teatro Municipal .
The UNESCO World Heritage site of Brazil 's sterile capital , Bras�lia , is one of wide and featureless boulevards and faceless high-rises .
An ambitious three-year project back in the 1960s , Brasilia has unfortunately not gone to plan .
For respite from the heat of the day , the popular Parque Nacional de Bras�lia , to the north of the city centre , is an ecological reserve with natural swimming pools .
Salvador da Bahia ( northeast of Brasilia on the Atlantic coast ) is one of Brazils cultural highlights - a fascinating and vibrant city loaded with historic buildings .
It is also well known for its many wild carnivals and festivals .
Farther north is historic and charming Olinda , one of the best-preserved colonial cities in Brazil , with many churches , museums and art galleries and a special bohemian atmosphere .
The mighty Amazon basin , a labyrinth of rivers and primary rainforests stretching into neighbouring countries , covers half of Brazil .
Thousands of species of creatures , many unclassified , inhabit the vast jungle and include river dolphins , anacondas , tapirs and jaguars to name but a few .
Manaus is the main town and jumping-off point for excursions into the Amazon and lies near to the Rio Negro .
Manaus itself has few attractions apart from the city 's most famous landmark , the stunning Teatro Amazonas - a striking Renaissance opera house .
In the west of Brazil , the Pantanal is a vast area of wetlands and wildlife sanctuary and is especially difficult to navigate .
Another striking feature is the spectacular Igua�u Falls on the border with Argentina and Paraguay .
These impressive falls rival those of Niagara and boast an even deeper plunge .

What makes instant messaging work for business ?
The concept of presence .
Here 's how it can work in other applications .
You may think you 're on the leading edge of technology if you 're a heavy email user , but email in its current form is an archaic communications medium .
It 's the big black rotary phone of your parents ' house compared to the tiny mobile phone you carry with you today .
And what is email 's greatest weakness ?
No , not spam .
Email lacks presence .
If you use instant messaging , you know the difference between old-fashioned email and the power of instant messaging .
And it 's not the speed .
It 's the fact that before you send an instant message , you have a very good idea if the person on the other end is there to receive it .
This makes instant messages , or IMs , succeed when email fails .
For example , if you want to see if Joe down the hall can join you for lunch , sending email is a bad idea because you do n't know if Joe is at his desk to read the mail .
Telephoning is intrusive .
Walking down the hall would tear you away from the other tasks you 're juggling .
But with IM , first , you find out if Joe is either at his desk or already gone ( so find another lunch date ) ; second , you know that if he is there and you send him a note , he 'll see it .
There 's no other medium like this .
Now this may not be news to you .
But the concept of presence that 's inherent to IM can also exist in other forms of communication .
It is n't in too many places yet , but hopefully it soon will be .
Email Some corporate products , such as Microsoft 's Live Communications Server , begin to merge email and an IM-like presence , but as far as I know , there 's no true presence-based email program available to consumers and small businesses .
I 've actually been berating email software vendors for a while for not creating an easy-to-use option that lets users see if the person who just sent them email is still around to receive a reply or a phone call or an IM .
There are interesting third-party solutions , though , that do this .
For example , Convoq 's ASAP allows you to embed a presence indicator in your email or on your Web site .
ASAP is designed to help you set up online meetings , which is Convoq 's main business , but communicating presence is a great feature on its own .
Yahoo 's online mail also has a presence indicator .
Of course , the big social challenge with email and presence would be managing privacy .
I do n't want every email I send out to signal my availability .
But within my company and among my closest friends , it 'd be useful .
I 'm still surprised there 's no good standard way to do this .
Telephone calls Caller ID is a small step towards bringing presence into mobile phones , and it shows , as does IM , that it has the value of transferring personal information before you start communicating in earnest .
But caller ID does n't go far enough .
Aside from making a phone ring , there 's no other way to signal the person you 're calling that you want to talk , and more importantly , there 's no way for that person to signal back if he or she does n't .
A few companies are solving this problem .
For example , SoloMio has something I call ' super caller ID ' .
Given the right technology on both the calling and the called phones , SoloMio allows the person receiving the call to send a quick text message back to the caller , such as , ' Sorry , I 'm busy now , ' or , ' I ca n't talk now but will call you in 10 minutes ' .
You can even have a quick text-based dialogue .
For example , I call you , and my caller ID appears on your phone .
You select a canned query in reply : ' Is it urgent ?
' I get a menu option to send back , ' Yes ' .
Then you pick up the phone .
This functionality is available today on a few cellular networks .
More smart applications Where else can we apply presence ?
If you start to think beyond simple person-to-person communications , the possibilities get really interesting .
For example , start-up NetMesh is developing a platform that enables applications to be aware of the user 's location and that also gives you information about the presence of people around the user .
In a medical setting , for example , the system can automatically display the record of the nearest patient on a doctor 's tablet computer , or in a group setting , it can ensure that all the medical personnel in a room are , by default , looking at data about the same patient .
Technology freed us , first from ploughs and , most recently , from our desks .
But now that we can work anywhere , we can be awfully hard to find .
It 's time to start making technology smarter about presence .
It could make our lives easier and our work more productive .
Friends of " Red " Arnott in the 2nd .
Battalion The 2nd would continue to fight until the end of the war .
They would fight in some of the final battles of the Great War including Amiens , Arras , Canal du Nord , and eventually the push through to Mons .
Their war ended with the Armistice of November 11 , 1918 .
The killing was finally over and at such a great cost , the 2nd Battalion had suffered 3,305 casualties , loosing 52 officers and 1,227 men in the three and a half years of their existence .
It was back to England , onto the SS Olympic , the same ship IKA had sailed over on , and back to Kingston , Ontario .
On the morning of April 24 , 1919 , at Barriefield Camp , the Battalion assembled for the last time .
Colonel L.T. McLauglin , their Commanding Officer , under the stress of deep emotion , thanked the men for their service .
Three cheers were given to McLaughlin by the men .
At 8:30am the 2nd Battalion was dismissed .
Pte .
Arnott had served with 2nd Battalion for 9 months .
The men of this Battalion lived , ate , slept , fought and sometimes died together .
It was an awful way to have spent their youth .
But they had to make the best of it when it was possible .
IKA , like any soldier , formed friends in the Battalion , probably saw some of them die , probably saw some suffer terribly , but through it all , he had friends who would help each other out in the worst of times and enjoy themselves at every opportunity .
On a sad note , the 2nd Battalion lost over 300 men during IKA 's time with the Battalion .
After the war , 2nd Battalion Associations were set up throughout the country , one was in the Windsor-Detroit area .
" Red " Arnott was an active member as were several others who served with the 2nd .
What exact relations these men had with IKA during the war years may never be known , but they were great friends afterwards , especially Hugh Smith , ' Slim ' Auckland and Jim Campbell .
The following are some of those men and what they accomplished with the 2nd Battalion .
Privates Thomas ( Tommy ) White , L.R. ( Slim ) Auckland , Gordon A. Parker , Jim Campbell , W.A. Bailey , H. Casselman , G.H. Campbell , S. Dell and H. Freid were all wounded while serving with the 2nd .
Pte .
Jim Campbell served with IKA .
Prior to the attack on Vimy Ridge , Campbell was with a group of men who staged a daylight raid into enemy territory .
Two men were badly wounded and Campbell attempted to carry one to safety , but due to enemy fire , he could not .
However , for his gallantry he was summoned to Divisional Headquarters , where he met General Arthur Currie , the commander of the 1st Division ( soon after he became the Commanding Officer of the Canadian Corps ) who commended him .
He was also treated to the outline of the great attack on Vimy Ridge that was to follow .
Sgt. Wilfred ( Wilf ) Berry started with the 2nd as a corporal , and worked his way up to sergeant .
He was awarded with " Mentioned in Despatches " ( Specifics unknown. ) Pte .
J.D. Dell ( served with IKA ) and Sgt J.D. Lightfoot were awarded the Military Medal .
Dell got his at Passchendaele ( Specifics Unknown ) The Military Medal was awarded to men , other than officers , for acts of bravery .
Corporal Victor Saren served at the same time as IKA .
He was a scout in the Scouts & Sniper Section of the 2nd .
At the Battle of Fresnoy , Cpl .
Saren manned a forward post , relaying information back to Battalion Headquarters .
This information was vital to the success of the 2nd at Fresnoy .
At the Battle of Passchendaele , Saren was awarded the Military Medal for his actions .
( Specfics unknown. ) Sgt. J.W. Connoy served at the same time as IKA .
He was awarded the Distinquished Conduct Medal , given to men other then officers , for acts of gallantry while in charge of men , at Hill 70 ( Aug .
1917 ) .
He showed " conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during enemy counter-attacks .
He was in charge of a platoon in an advanced position and continued to hold it though for a time cut off from the main line " In April of 1919 ( Bramshott , England ) , Company Sergeant Major Connoy was a member of the recieving party of the 2nd Battalion when it was officially presented with their Regimental Colours by the Minister of Militia , Sir Edward Kemp .
Captain Hugh Smith also served at the same time as IKA .
This man was one of the most highly decorated men to serve with the 2nd Battalion during the war .
Smith joined the 2nd as a corporal , and would earn the Military Medal for his reconnaissance work at Hill 60 ( Ypres Salient , west of Ypres , Belgium ) , in July 1916 .
At that time he was a scout in the Scout & Sniper Section .
He was promoted to Lieutenant after the Battle of the Somme ( Sept/Oct 1916 ) and was given command of a platoon ( 40 men ) .
His greatest , yet most tragic moment came at the Battle of Hill 70 ( near Lens , France ) .
In the early morning hours of August 18 , 1917 , after the Canadians had captured the Hill 70 , the Germans counter-attacked , 21 times .
At the time , Smith 's company commander was Major Okill Massey Learmonth .
One of the counterattacks was directed at Learmonth 's company .
It included the Germans ' use of a relatively new weapon of death , the ' flame-thrower ' .
Smith killed the German , took his ' flame-thrower ' , which he returned to Battalion headquarters for inspection .
On another counterattack , Learmonth himself offered stout defence as the battle raged furiously .
At times he was seen standing on the trench parapet , directing his men and on several occasions was forced to throw back the German grenades that had been tossed his way .
He was twice wounded during the fierce hand to hand combat that followed .
Despite a third wound , he continued to direct his company while lying in the bottom of a trench .
Finally , Learmonth could go on no more , he turned his company command over to Lieut .
Smith .
Even though he was dying , Learmonth insisted on been taken to Battalion Headquarters so he could verbally report the situation .
Major Learmonth later died from his wounds .
For his courageous efforts , the 23 year old was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross .
He was later buried in the Barlin ( France ) Cemetery .
" Red " Arnott ( in white trousers ) with fellow-veterans .
His friend , Hugh Smith , is the second man to " Red 's " right .
For his gallant efforts , Smith was awarded the Military Cross .
This was a bravery decoration given to junior officers .
It is very likely that Learmonth earned his Victoria Cross because of Smith 's recommendation , since Smith was one of the highest ranking officers to wittness this act of gallantry .
Smith would later earn a bar on his Military Cross , again for bravery , during the Battle of Canal du Nord ( September 3/4 , 1918 ) .
Also , during the battle , he was slightly wounded twice , but refused to be attended to .
After the Battle of Passchendaele ( Nov .
1917 ) , Smith was promoted to Captain and given command of one of the four companies of the 2nd Battalion , Company " A " .
He would remain in position until the end of the war with exception of several special assignments with Battalion Headquarters .
Smith was truly a heroic yet a very lucky soldier .
He was involved in at least eight of the bloodiest battles of the Great War and emerged relatively unscathed .
Smith returned from the Great War with his English bride .
After the war , ' Red ' and Hugh ( wives Lottie and Margaret ) , maintained a very close friendship .
Hugh ( who live in Detroit ) would often ' smuggle ' over ' Red 's ' favourite cigarettes , the U.S. made Chesterfields !

Claude Chabrol 1930 - Present , France With his 1958 debut feature , Le Beau Serge , Chabrol is regarded to have provided the spearhead for the nouvelle vague ( ' new wave ' ) movement in French cinema that would hold under its banner such names as Francois Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard , and Louis Malle .
It was a term the directors liked to use for themselves , but in fact their approaches varied sufficiently for the term to have a conveniently broad meaning .
As Chabrol put it : " There is no new wave , only the sea .
" After the mixed critical and commercial reception of early efforts - such as The Cousins , Les Bonnes Femmes , Ophelia - Chabrol turned to more marketable offerings such as the spy caper The Tiger Likes Fresh Blood and Second World war yarn La Ligne de Demarcation .
At the end of the 1960s he returned to more serious territory , but in the 70s and 80s produced films of variable quality - The Twist , Violette , The Story of Women - and 1991's Madam Bovary is a rather lifeless adaptation .
His frequent treatments of the subjects of murder , obsession , sex and infidelity - Wedding in Blood , This Man Must Die , Blood Relatives , L'Enfer , Merci Pour le Chocolat ( far less sickly than it sounds ) - have earned Chabrol the reputation as something of a French Hitchcock .

Monday , 13 December 2004 Walk-in centres must attract men The Forum has come up with some ideas to make walk-in centres , which are increasingly popular with the government , more attractive to men .
' We have raised with Health Minister John Hutton how new NHS walk-in centres might more effectively tackle men’s health issues , ' said MHF director Peter Baker .
' We believe that the centres have the potential to encourage many men who would otherwise not seek help from their GP to do so , or to seek help sooner. ' To ensure that the new , and existing , walk-in centres maximize their potential for providing healthcare for men , the Forum has proposed : a marketing campaign aimed at men specifically ; a particular effort to attract men who are socio-economically disadvantaged , for instance through large local employers of manual/clerical workers – and also by outreach services to specific venues ( eg. local pubs , betting offices , barbers’ shops , workplaces , etc ) ; that walk-in centres are encouraged to participate in National Men’s Health Week from June 13-19th 2005 focusing on men and weight/obesity ; careful monitoring of the demographics of service users and that service evaluations take gender fully into account ; that the lessons of the walk-in centres are applied to traditional GP provision where appropriate .
The Forum has also reiterated its long-standing concern that men are reluctant users of GP services and that GP services themselves have done little to encourage men to attend .
' We are concerned that the new GMS contract , which is leading to a reduction in out-of-hours services by GPs , including Saturday morning clinics , may well have a further negative effect on men’s use of primary care , ' said Peter Baker .

Bowel Cancer Bowel cancer ( also called colorectal or colon cancer ) information from My Pharmacy UK Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK with 30,000 new cases every year , and about 1 in 20 of us can expect to get it at some point in our life .
Bowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK with 16,000 people dying from it every year , so it 's something worth knowing about and taking seriously , as it is almost completely preventable by leading a healthier life .
Bowel cancer affects mostly older people , with 90 % of cases in the over 50's , but it will have started to slowly grow many years earlier , so young to middle age is the time to prevent it .
Most bowel cancer is caused by the ' western diet ' .
There is 20 times less bowel cancer in China and Japan than there is in America , but if someone moves to America the family acquires the national level within a generation due to their change in diet .
Bowel cancer is increasing by about 1 % a year but if caught early there is a good chance of survival , so seeing your doctor if there are any early signs is very important .
Leaving things too late reduces the chance of survival .
The early signs of bowel cancer to look out for are - Blood or mucus in the stools Becoming constipated or getting diarrhoea , which does not go away Losing weight without any explanation Pain in the abdomen or bottom Having to strain to pass a motion Feeling a lump in the abdomen Blood in the stools can be seen as fresh red blood on your toilet paper , or in the toilet .
This indicates bleeding near to the end of your bowel .
Bleeding higher up the bowel can be more difficult to see as the blood is mixed in with the faeces , and has had time to clot .
This is why a chemical test is used for detection .
This is called a faecal occult blood test ( FOB Test ) , which you can also buy yourself .
Because early detection is important this is one of the Department of Health 's targets , so there will be the first phase of a national screening campaign in England starting in April 2006 , with men and women aged 60 to 69 invited to take part .
Those eligible will be sent a home test kit and asked to scrape small sample of faeces onto the test card and send it back to the lab for testing .
If you are over 70 years old you can ask for a test .
The lab will use a chemical test for blood in the sample , and let you know if this is positive , as this is one of the early signs of bowel cancer .
If blood is found in the sample , then a second test is sent .
About 2 out of every 100 people tested are expected to have both results show positive , and they will be asked to go for further tests .
However it is estimated that only 1 in 20 people who go for further tests have bowel cancer , as most cases of blood being found in your stools are due to haemorrhoids ( piles ) , or to other bowel problems such as diverticulitis , ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's Disease , which can then be treated .
Note that a negative result could happen when you do have bowel cancer , and it just is n't bleeding when the test is done , so you should not ignore the early signs just because your test is negative .
Recommended Book - Click here for more details Coping with Bowel Cancer It is hoped to save 2,000 lives a year with this faecal occult blood screening test ( FOB Test ) , by detecting bowel cancer earlier , and also raising awareness of it 's existence , and the signs to look out for , so that more people will seek help earlier .
However , earlier screening trials have only shown a reduction in mortality of 15 % , not a lot to show for all this effort !
So do n't rely on this screening and think that all is well .
Concentrate on the fact that 90 % of bowel cancer is cause by poor diet , and this is completely under your control .
Other people at risk of developing bowel cancer are anyone suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's Disease .
Around 5-10 % of people who get bowel cancer have a family history of the disease , and it usually appears before the age of 45 .
These people should be especially aware of early signs of the disease , and use screening tests as recommended by their doctor .
Prevent bowel cancer by looking after your bowels .
In simple terms eat food with a high fibre content , which stays in the bowel as bulk , and moves everything through more quickly .
Highly refined and processed foods have less bulk and pass more slowly through the gut .
The slower your food passes through you , the more chance there is for cancer forming chemicals to be produced , damaging small areas of the gut , which can become cancerous .
Red meat and animal fat can produce chemicals that do this , so limit the amount of red meat and saturated fats you eat .
Exercise regularly to keep the gut moving , and help your food go down .
Being overweight puts extra pressure on the gut and slows your food down .
How to prevent bowel cancer - Eat plenty of fibre Exercise regularly Lose excess weight Eat less red meat & saturated fat Look after your nutrition Eat plenty of fibre .
All fibre is good for the gut , as it moves things through quickly , but there are two types of fibre which act differently .
Insoluble fibre ( wheat bran and whole grains ) is believed to absorb cancer causing chemicals produced in the gut , and decrease the risk of bowel cancer .
Soluble fibre ( fruit , vegetables , beans and pulses ) form a thick gel which lubricates the bowel walls and feeds the healthy bacteria in the lower bowel .
So make sure you get at least your five portions of fruit and vegetables each day .
Ensure a regular daily intake of green vegetables , particularly brassicas ( cabbage , broccoli , sprouts or cauliflower ) .
Recent studies have also shown that specific chemicals in vegetables , for example the isothiocyanates , which give brassicas their characteristic pungent taste , might be especially protective against cancer .
Exercise regularly .
Studies have shown that the risk of bowel cancer can be reduced by as much as 50 % in people who exercise regularly .
This does n't have to be anything too energetic , as walking , gardening , and anything that gets you just a little out of breath really helps .
It is thought to affect hormone levels and increase your metabolic rate , and help the bowel to get rid of waste more quickly .
Loosing excess weight improves your life and your bowels , especially when combined with the healthy eating and exercise .
Sounds familiar ?
This is just one of the reasons you should be doing it .
Eat less red meat & saturated fat and eat more fish .
Ideally eat red meat no more than once a week,as they produce cancer causing chemicals while being digested , in particular , avoid burnt meat , such as barbeques , which already contains cancer-promoting chemicals called cyclic amines .
Fish and white meat are much better .
Look after your nutrition .
Some studies have shown the beneficial effects of taking multivitamin & mineral supplements , and vitamin C , vitamin E , folic acid , selenium and calcium have been singled out as being the most important .

Casualty - every episode of which plays like a politically correct disaster movie - is one of the most downright entertaining shows on British television .
This article attempts to look at the programme 's content and structure to discover what makes it so enjoyable .
Casualty has become the slickest example yet of a particular TV genre ( and a BBC-dominated one ) : the ' institutional ' drama series of which Z Cars , Angels , Juliet Bravo etc. were all examples .
This genre can be defined by its setting , by the way its self-contained and ongoing plots operate , by its relationship to ideas of ' realism ' , and by its concern with social and ethical issues of the day .
1. Structure One of the first things the viewer notices about Casualty is that each episode moves very fast .
Each 50 minute episode consists of around 50 scenes , with ( usually ) three major plots plus a couple of self-contained sub-plots and still more sub- plots which develop between episodes to reward regular viewing .
As an example , here 's what goes on in the episode ' Tender Loving Care ' : Major Plots : A. An elderly man collapses in a synagogue .
He 's saved by staff on Holby Hospital 's accident and emergency ward , but afterwards his wife - a stroke victim - collapses and dies .
B. A boy being bullied on a school trip collapses from sickle cell disease .
The A&E ( Accident and Emergency ) team manage to revive him .
C. A man deliberately self-induces an asthma attack to keep his estranged wife with him .
A hospital blunder leads to him being given the wrong medicine .
He intends to sue , but his wife stops him by threatening to reveal that he 's been assaulting her .
Sub-Plots This Episode : A. A homeless woman is stopped from sleeping in the A&E ward , and turns out to have been stealing its charity boxes .
B. The reception staff get into trouble for ordering pizzas for patients .
Sub-Plots Continuing Between Episodes : A. Duffy ( the ward sister ) goes for a biopsy examination and is asked to return for more tests .
B. A nurse , Sandra , continues her awkward romantic relationship with the irascible consultant Julian .
C. Receptionist Norma becomes increasingly worried about her elderly mother , with whom she lives .
For the regular viewer , part of the pleasure of watching Casualty is in watching the regular formula unfold .
In the first 20-25 minutes , the narrative interest is focussed on what accident is going to befall the characters ( often played by well-known TV faces ) who have been introduced in this episode .
In this episode , for example , we start to guess that the boy Ben is going to collapse from sickle cell disease , and we can see disaster looming when the staff are distracted from treating the asthmatic Adam .
The remaining 25-30 minutes are generally spent resolving each accident or crisis .
Normally , we can expect an episode to contain three emergencies , at least one of which will end in death .
It 's not unusual for the show to end with one patient still fighting for life .
The disparate plots are often linked by having scenes change their subject in mid-flow , so that ( as in Hill Street Blues ) the camera will follow one character or group and then pick up on a different character as their paths cross .
Yet the fact that Casualty runs to formula does n't diminish the suspense .
On the contrary , it increases the tension for the viewer , since we know that at least one of this week 's characters is not going to make it to the end alive - and we want to know who and why .
2. Characters Casualty ' s paradigmatic structure .
Soap opera critics have talked about the paradigmatic nature of their genre : we enjoy the show more if we know the characters ' history and can relate occurrences in the story with a network of past experiences and relationships .
Something similar happens in Casualty , which builds elements of the soap opera into essentially self-contained episodes .
There are 10 main characters in the programme 's 1992-93 season , besides a couple who appear occasionally .
( A checklist : Charlie , Duffy , Ash , Sandra , Norma , Rob , Max , Josh , Jane and Julian , who was re-placed by Mike in mid-series. ) We are given an insight into the private lives of a couple of characters per episode : Charlie 's fight with alcoholism and his unhappy relationships ; Duffy 's affair and engagement , and her worries over a smear test ; Julian and Sandra 's ill-fated affair , etc. The show rewards regular viewers by building up a soap opera style paradigm of relationships .
For example , in the ' Tender Loving Care ' episode , when the receptionist Norma consoles an elderly man about the death of his wife , she tells him he should be glad she did n't linger for years like some people .
The scene means more to regular viewers because we know Norma has an aged mother to care for - a situation which has been affecting her life and her work throughout the series .
A side effect of this paradigmatic structure is that the show does n't depend on any one character .
It 's already survived the departure of several of its most popular personnel , including one played by Oscar winner Brenda Fricker , and would probably be able to carry on even if Derek Thompson ( Charlie ) should leave , because other characters are being groomed for succession .
Actors need the series more than it needs them .
3. ' Realism ' People often praise Casualty for being �realistic� or criticise it for being �unrealistic� .
Holby ( its fictitious setting ) is clearly based on Bristol ( where the show is shot ) ; the series often draws its plot ideas from the headlines ; and publicity is always keen to stress the authenticity of the medical scenes .
But the insistence on using the word realism tells us more about British critics ' obsession with that word than about the programme itself .
Plainly , an episode of Casualty is n't representative of reality on an A&E ward - otherwise its running time would be largely taken up by people waiting to be treated for sprains and zip fastener injuries .
Casualty makes exciting drama precisely because it depicts incidents which are atypical in an A&E ward : squash players impaled on their rackets , farmers whose feet have been chopped off by their machinery , hunt saboteurs trampled by horses and children crushed in ram-raids , for example .
But the programme 's medical authenticity is a vital part of the viewer 's enjoyment , because it presents us with an endurance test .
We like to watch its gory moments without flinching because it somehow enables us to feel we 've seen something horrible and conquered our squeamishness .
The series depends on convincing special effects , otherwise this part of its appeal -based on the viewer 's faith that the gory moments are depicted accurately - would be lost .
4. The liberal view Each episode of Casualty raises a host of political , social and medical issues .
To take the ' Tender Loving Care ' episode as an example again , the issues dealt with here are : Domestic violence Homelessness Bullying Under-staffing of the NHS The dangers of ' hooking ' patients on prescription drugs .
The need for women to have prompt smear tests The ethics of suing hospitals for their mistakes .
Another episode , ' Body and Soul ' explores blood sports ( taking care to feature ' good ' and ' bad huntsmen ) , rape ( along with the problems involved with reporting it to the police ) and the ethics of non-violent protest versus direct action .
Like other shows in whose footsteps it follows , Casualty adopts a liberal/left of centre political position .
The series depicts the problems created by the NHS reforms ( Holby Hospital has become an NHS trust ) , yet union militancy is usually ruled out as a solution : Charlie struggles on under the new management but has to deal with complaints from the more political union rep Ash .
The show 's attention to social issues was demonstrated in the last episode of the 1992-93 season , ' Boiling Point ' , and it would be almost impossible to discuss the series without mentioning the furore surrounding this edition .
Re-scheduled to go out after the 9pm watershed , the episode was the subject of hundreds of complaints , and the outcry prompted a disgraceful climb down from the BBC , which said the programme had " gone too far " .
The plot had a gang of thugs setting fire to the hospital , and the complainants said it could have prompted copycat attacks .
Setting aside the fact that a similar incident had already occurred in reality , this knee-jerk response to violence on TV shows once more the Mary Whitehouse lobby 's assumption of a hypodermic model of audience response : the complainants think potential yobs would not only be at home on a Saturday night watching Casualty , but would be tempted to try burning down their local hospital .
Yet the ' Boiling Point ' episode was an instant TV classic .
It tackled some of the most important issues of the 1990s : the lawlessness of Tory Britain , the public belief that the police ca n't help and the ethics of vigilante action .
And it worked all this into a hugely exciting thriller which had a hospital under siege , patients dying on the hospital forecourt , and a regular character ( Rob ) being badly injured in a disaster .
Despite its serious treatment of important issues , the protesters could see nothing except the fact that violence took place on screen .
The BBC 's lily livered response - and reports that the producers have been told to tone down the next series - may mean the 1993-94 series of Casualty is more timid .
That would be a great loss to television .
Postscript Nearly ten years later the BBC is still producing Casualty and it has bred a spin-off series , Holby City .
Meanwhile ITV has produced a rival series A & E , and there is the US series ER .
ER �s fast pace and action has had a big influence on the British hospital dramas .

The Final Kent Years brings to a close Ace 's three-volume presentation of the complete 60s and 70s recordings waxed by Lowell Fulson for the Bihari brothers ' Los Angeles-based Kent and Big Town labels .
Black Nights ( CDCHD 804 ) traced this memorable alliance from its 1964 beginning with those well-crafted early blues singles .
There was much contribution from manager-songwriter Ferdinand " Fats " Washington together with West Coast R&B icon Maxwell Davis , who was in his final glory as arguably LA 's greatest studio force in his field .
The ' Tramp ' Years ( CDCHD 755 ) continued through Lowell 's rejuvenation on the charts as a funkster and link in the musical food chain to hip-hop .
Here , The Final Kent Years reprises Lowell 's last two albums for the family combine , his last Kent single and three more recently unearthed tunes .
The first major component of the set is the " Now !
" LP , which made a typical Bihari trek through a series of cheapie labels after its Kent debut .
This album largely takes us to the end of Lowell 's main run with the company in 1968 .
Though " Now !
" attracted no great notice at the time , and it was Lowell 's only Kent LP not framed around a hit , it holds up very well .
The brassy , ornate tracks have energetic performances by Lowell as big as the orchestrations-.-the stripped-down outings show Lowell close to his roots with frequent gospel tinges-.-his take on the covers is fresh and spirited .
Throughout , the recently resurgent Arthur Adams 's outstanding input as a guitarist , and as co-author of the shuffling dance anthem Push Me ( probably a reflection of Adams 's time on the Dallas " Push club " circuit that spawned Anson Funderburgh ) , takes the proceedings to another level .
Five worthy loose ends from the period , including the last Kent single , provide a point of departure for the nine-year gap ( with stints at Jewel and Granite ) before Lowell 's return to the Bihari fold .
" Lovemaker " was the one-off product of a February 1978 outing under the auspices of indie vet George Mottola .
It originally appeared , like " Now !
" , to no discernible fanfare , on Big Town .
While probably a low budget project of modest pretensions and not an essential in many LP piles , " Lovemaker " is nonetheless a good , solid , straight-ahead blues excursion .
The band is basic and Lowell gets a goodly share of the guitar spotlight .
Amid some standards which underscore Lowell 's longtime affinity for Tampa Red , Lowell 's originals tend toward midtempo blues , notably Bending Like A Willow Tree ( covered by Albert Collins ) and My Mind Is Trying To Leave Me , attributed to Lowell and his good friend Percy Mayfield and also revived by Collins .
Lowell went on to cut a number of fine albums for American , Canadian and European labels before his death at Long Beach CA on 7 March 1999 .
With these three Ace CDs , we have his 1964-78 Bihari catalogue to revisit with unprecedented depth , sound quality and convenience .
It represents as full a spectrum as any such teaming could of the dimensions of Lowell Fulson ' s blues mastery , surrounded by quality writers , producers , arrangers and musicians .
The association ranks with Lowell 's most definitive and successful epochs , prolific and , in bursts , profitable .
The Final Kent Years rounds out four hours of some of the most elemental and enjoyable reminders of what a resilient , flexible and passionately expressive great Lowell Fulson was .

The biggest challenge in Monterrey is the heat .
It is always very hot and humid .
In the last two years , the temperature has been around 115� F ( 46�C ) , and the heat in the car makes this race very demanding .
You have to keep hydrated during the race , but you also have to be physically prepared before the race .
On race day , I lose almost eight pounds of fluid .
The track itself is tight with a lot of good corners , but little tyre grip , so there 's a lot of hanging on because you 're sliding around quite a bit .
That means you 're on the brakes a little more and playing with the controls to handle the car .
When you 're on cold tyres , everything steps up a bit because you have even less feeling .
The lack of grip is caused by a couple of things .
First , the type of asphalt on the track has less grip than other surfaces and , second , the track is not used that often , so it has more dust on it .
The tyre rubber we lay down during race weekend does help to create grip over the three days. However , that creates a lot more set -up challenges , as the grip changes from Friday to Sunday .
Because of the low grip , the set-up on the car is critical in Monterrey .
The corners seem to run longer on a low-grip track , so you have to really be able to communicate with your engineer how to get as much grip as possible .
I qualified third here in 2004 and second in 2005 , so I 'm hoping to continue that trend in 2006 .

As Albert Einstein once said , ' no number of experiments can ever prove that I am right , but a single experiment , at any time , can prove that I am wrong ' .
Some people see this element of doubt as one of the weaknesses of science , as its failure .
I see this element of doubt as one of the finest qualities of science , as its real grandeur - the fact that one cannot rely upon absolute truth , and that one might be wrong .
If only people could accept the idea that perhaps , they might be wrong , then this would put an end to political , moral , racial , and in particular all forms of religious fanaticism .

APRIL MEETING - RECOLLECTIONS OF A BEVIN BOY by Les Mitten MAY MEETING - THE DUKERIES AND SHERWOOD FOREST by David Ottewell NOTES AND QUERIES AND HELP WANTED AND OFFERED LETTERS TO THE EDITOR EDITORIAL It hardly seems possible that summer is over and this is the Autumn Journal .
Many thanks for all the articles , both long and short , we hope to include them all within the next few issues .
Please keep them coming since without you we would not have a Journal .
Please note the new look to the publications lists which we hope will make ordering much easier for those members who use this facility .
Jim and Pauline Chettle FROM THE SECRETARY The Society has recently purchased further microfiche of the GRO indexes .
We now have the Deaths from 1837 up to 1922 and these can be searched as well as the Births and Marriages which we have from 1837 to 1925 .
If you wish to have information from these , please use the form from the April Journal and send any requests to MrFolkett as before .
They will also be available at our Saturday sessions .
Since 1989 Mr and Mrs Careless have looked after the Society 's set of the IGI and have sent it to members on loan as requested .
Unfortunately they now feel that the time has come for someone else to continue this service .
We are very grateful to them for helping so many people to have access to the fiche and for running this service so efficiently .
We are also very grateful to Mrs Mary Sutton for agreeing to take over the IGI service .
Anyone wishing to use it should contact Mary at 60 Roseleigh Avenue , Westdale Lane , Mapperley , Nottingham , NG3 6FH .
Recently we have had some members asking about printing their E mail addresses in the Journal .
Rather than put in single ones we thought it would be better to put in a whole set .
If you have an E mail address that you would like us to print , please send it to me by 30th November so we can publish a list in the January Journal , With this Journal you will find a renewal form for your 1998 subscription .
Pat Cherry will be pleased to receive your subscriptions from now on .
Please note you will not receive your January Journal until we have received your 1998 subscription !
Should anyone feel they can join the covenant scheme for their subscriptions , please write to me for a form before you pay your subscription .
Sheila Leeds PRESIDENT'S REMARKS Since our last Journal there have been some changes in the administration of the Society and in the running of our meetings .
Firstly , Dominic Johnson-Bland , who for some time now has been running the Society 's bookstall and publications/fiche ordering , has taken on a new role as Family History Research Advisor .
The Council of the Society believes this will be a useful service that can be offered to members , both postal and at meetings , and Dominic , with her wealth of experience , is ideally suited for this position .
Please note that this service is for advice only , for example on what to search ; it is not a service to do actual research for members .
Secondly , the bookstall in turn has been taken over by Sheila Greenall , who already runs the Society 's postal service for publications and fiche .
Sheila is also taking over the standing order service which until recently was run by Mary Butler .
We would like to thank Dominic , Sheila and Mary for their valuable help , and we hope members who may be stuck with their research might like to contact Dominic either by post or at meetings .
You never know , there could be something else to try that you had never thought of !
Peter Hammond APRIL MEETING RECOLLECTIONS OF A BEVIN BOY by Les Mitten In the early war years , over 36,000 miners left the industry for better paid work .
The Government decided it needed 40,000 more miners but despite asking service men to opt for this reserved occupation , little impact was made on the numbers needed .
In September 1943 an appeal was made to Head Teachers of relevant schools but this seemed to be ignored , and so on December 1943 Ernest Bevin masterminded a scheme whereby a ballot took place to put men called up for Services into the mines instead .
The only exceptions were men accepted for flying duties in the RAF or Fleet Air Arm , men accepted for work in submarines and men on a shortlist of highly skilled occupations required for Service trades .
Each month Mr Bevin 's secretary put 10 digits into a hat and , for a period of approximately 20 months , two of these numbers were drawn out and all those men whose National Service Registration Number ended with that digitwere directed into Coal Mining without exception .
Mr Mitten 's number came out of the hat and he was sent a letter directing him to the mines at Creswell .
Most Bevin Boys were put into hostels but some lodged with families , which in Mr Mitten 's case was a family in Mansfield .
After Creswell Colliery came New Hucknall Colliery at Huthwaite , working on the screens , picking out stones etc. This was followed by emptying ash waggons by hand shovel onto the slag heaps .
All a far cry from the teleprinter work which he had been trained to do by the Post Office prior to ' call up ' .
Mr Mitten 's career then followed an unusual path as the Colliery Doctor decided he was not Al because of his eyesight and refused to let him work underground .
The Colliery wanted to get rid of him but were not allowed to do so .
Eventually he was made Assistant Timekeeper .
This meant going down the pit at least three times a week for various meetings and did enable him to develop a good working knowledge of the mines despite the fact that he still yearned to be in the Forces .
Eventually at 19 years he became the Colliery Timekeeper , although most of the Bevin Boys did work on the haulage system underground .
When a new Colliery Manager was appointed he decided that he wanted a male secretary and Mr Mitten was appointed Colliery Manager 's Clerk , which meant he was able to observe all the changes in 1947 when the NCB was established , These changes , however , did not affect the Bevin Boys immediately as they could not ask for their pre-war jobs as could demobbed Servicemen .
The Bevin Boys were not covered by the laws of the land and originally when they were demobbed they were not given travel warrants , suits etc. but this was eventually amended .
One of the popular misconceptions was that many Bevin Boys were conscientious objectors but in fact only six such objectors opted for the mines .
Mr Mitten admitted that with hindsight it was not such a bad life although they were all disappointed to be selected for the collieries even though this selection probably saved the lives of many .
A few of the Bevin Boys were injured but none ever received a pension as they were regarded as civilians .
The last of the Bevin Boys were demobbed in 1948 with very few opting to stay in the industry .
Mr Mitten 's release came through in August 1947 , but he had agreed to stay on until October of that year to finish a project on statistics with which he had become involved .
Report by Pauline Chettle MAY MEETING THE DUKERIES AND SHERWOOD FOREST by David Ottewell Mr Ottewell 's talk took the form of a gentle stroll around the Dukeries and Sherwood Forest , including its villages , illustrated by slides of some of his hundreds of postcards of Nottinghamshire .
He began by showing photographs of the Forest as we think of it and then extended outwards to include all the villages which used to lie within its boundaries .
Many of these have changed very little over the years and were instantly recognisable .
Finally , Mr Ottewell showed slides of both the inside and outside of the important big houses which were built in that part of the Forest known as The Dukeries .
It served to remind us all of our fast disappearing county heritage and the joy of old postcards in bringing it to life .
